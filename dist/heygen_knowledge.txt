COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Farmington Hills, MI Indian Wedding by 97 Films September 19, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments When it comes to South Asian weddings, words like “grand” and “lavish” sometimes feel like understatements. This wedding, however, redefined what it means to celebrate love in technicolor style—with thought
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ful planning, dazzling décor, and cinematography that makes you feel like you’re sitting front row at a blockbuster premiere. Marigold Wedding Planners brought the couple’s dream to life, blending artistry and precision in equal measure . From start to finish, every detail was planned with the kind of care that only seasoned pros can deliver. Guest experience was top of mind—no detail too small, no floral garland too delicate. And speaking of florals, their designs transformed every venue into a fragrant fairytale. Imagine mandaps that seemed to float on blooms, tablescapes that whispered romance, and entrances that felt like stepping into another world. Marigold didn’t just decorate; they orchestrated an atmosphere. The festivities kicked off at Farmington Hills Manor , where the sangeet
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | sparkled with vibrant energy and dancing that could rival a Bollywood stage. The vows were exchanged at the elegant Wabeek Country Club , where lush greenery created a natural frame for the sacred rituals. To cap it all off, the Meridian Banquet & Conference Center hosted a reception so glamorous that chandeliers and couture outfits were practically in competition for the spotlight. Here’s where the magic hit another level. 97 Films captured every glance, every laugh, every twirl of the lehenga with cinematic finesse. Their work doesn’t just document moments—it turns them into timeless art. Watching the wedding film feels like being whisked back into the celebration: the music swelling at just the right second, the slow-motion baraat entrance (yes, goosebumps included), and the way the cou
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ple’s chemistry lights up the screen. If wedding films had Oscars, this one would have at least three. Rosy & Shaun Wedding Photography ensured no emotion went unnoticed, snapping portraits that could double as cover art for a romance novel. Magda Violin Rocks elevated the ceremony with melodies that tugged at heartstrings, while Sugar Events & Entertainment kept the dance floor alive well into the night. Add in JHobby Makeup Studio’s glam touch, Arnold Cakes’ sweet confections, and the artistry of Pavi Henna Art , and you’ve got a wedding that checks every “wow” box imaginable. The flavors of the celebration came courtesy of Raj Palace Catering , a spread so indulgent that guests were probably plotting second (and third) helpings before the first course was finished. From appetizers to de
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | sserts, it was the kind of menu that lingers in memory long after the last toast. This wedding wasn’t just an event—it was an experience, layered with tradition, artistry, and joy . A big shout-out to the vendors whose talent turned love into magic. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? It was modern dating with a twist! We met on good old Dil Mil, but had a few common friends who vetted for each other. The first message Manuj sent to me was "Punjabi, loves dogs/Mexican food, and enjoys the beach, check to all of that, when can the dholi come?" It was love at first text, and we knew how special it was that we connected. We spent the first year of dating long-distance, and eagerly waited to see one another every few weeks. They say you cannot take the Texas out
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | of a man (and this is true!), but I took the man out of Texas! Manuj moved to Michigan for us, and our relationship flourished. I knew he was the one from all the compromises, unselfish love, and commitment he made. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? I think the absolute best part of our wedding that our guests and we loved was having our dog, Zen, be a part of our Haldi ceremony. Zen is the light of our life, and it was imperative he had a role in our wedding events. We were so touched that all our guests enjoyed his sweet company. He brought his good energy to our Haldi, and it is a forever memory! Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? Reading our vows aloud at the Hindu ceremony was the most special and loving mo
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ment. It was something we always wanted to do, and we're so happy to have that core memory. Our vows were vulnerable, raw, and we deeply expressed our profound love to each other. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? Stay calm and enjoy the planning process (as much as you can!) Once the wedding events begin, take a moment to process all that is going on because you blink and it's gone!

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Fords, NJ Indian Wedding by Universal Photography September 18, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Every so often, a wedding comes along that reminds us why South Asian celebrations are truly in a league of their own. Natasha & Alain's multi-day affair was a symphony of culture, style,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | and heart—set against venues that were as memorable as the couple themselves. From a garba night that sparkled with color to a ceremony filled with reverence and a reception dripping in glamour, this wedding had it all. The festivities began at Akbar Restaurant , where Natasha & Alain hosted their lively sangeet. With bright hues, playful décor, and a night full of music and dance, the celebration captured the essence of togetherness. When it came time to exchange vows, the timeless charm of Christ United Methodist Church set the stage for a heartfelt ceremony. Natasha glided down the aisle in elegance, her look perfected by Glam by Rabs , who transformed her into a vision of grace with flawless hair and makeup. The floral artistry of Mandap Milap brought softness and romance to the church
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | , ensuring every corner whispered love. But the magic didn’t stop there. The couple’s grand reception at Royal Albert’s Palace was nothing short of regal. Imagine shimmering chandeliers, dazzling décor, and an atmosphere that felt both intimate and spectacular. Mandap Milap once again worked their floral magic, while Baked by Iryna sweetened the night with a cake that was as stunning as it was delicious. Guests were welcomed into a world of luxury and joy, with every detail curated to perfection. The heartbeat of the celebration, however, pulsed thanks to Kurani Studios . More than just a DJ, they orchestrated the soundtrack to Natasha and Alain’s love story. Their team didn’t just play music—they created an experience. From the electrifying baraat, where Kurani Studios set the tone with b
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | eats that had everyone dancing in the streets, to the reception where the lighting design transformed the ballroom into a glowing wonderland, their touch elevated the celebration from memorable to unforgettable. Guests snapped endless memories at the Kurani Studios photo booth, keeping the energy alive long after the last song. It was a masterclass in how one vendor’s versatility can impact every single part of a wedding weekend. Behind the lens, Universal Photography and Chirag Patel Cinematography worked in tandem, ensuring every candid smile and every teardrop was preserved forever. Their work captured the grandeur of the events without losing the intimacy of the couple’s love story. From Natasha’s mehndi by Alfaaz , etched with intricate detail, to the grand finale, this wedding was a
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | journey—one filled with laughter, tradition, and the kind of energy that makes you wish you could hit rewind and live it all over again. Natasha & Alain’s celebration proved that when love meets artistry, and when a dream team of vendors comes together, the result is pure Maharani magic.

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Chino Hills, CA Indian Wedding by Yin Studio September 16, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments When two worlds come together under California sunshine, you get a wedding like no other—Disha & Zack’s breathtaking celebration was the perfect blend of culture, elegance, and pure joy. From sacred vows at the iconic Chino Hills BAPS Mandir to an opulent reception at the elegant Vellano Estate , this wedding was nothing short of
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | unforgettable. The morning began with artistry. Henna by Sanjana brought the tradition of mehndi to every swirl , while Glamorized by Penny Kohli worked her magic with flawless hair, makeup, and sari draping that made Disha glow brighter than the California sun. Dressed in a stunning creation from Kynah , our Maharani looked every bit the queen she was meant to be. And when the veil was perfectly tied? That was the kind of “mic drop” bridal moment every girl dreams of. Picture majestic temple architecture, floral artistry by both the Chino Hills BAPS Mandir team and Events by FS , and vows exchanged under a mandap that looked carved straight from a dream. Zack’s entrance had the perfect balance of fun and reverence—because what’s a baraat if not a joyful dance party on the way to forever?
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | With Events by Sep orchestrating every detail, guests could simply bask in the beauty without a worry in sight. When the sun dipped and reception time arrived, Vellano Estate transformed into the ultimate stage for glamour. Guests indulged in decadent treats by Some Crust Bakery , proving that love may feed the soul, but cake feeds the celebration. The celebration was captured with perfection by Yin Studio , whose lens caught everything from stolen glances to the kind of laughter that can only come when surrounded by your favorite people. With his cinematic eye, Robles Video Productions preserved every movement, every tear, every dance. Disha & Zack’s wedding was not just about two people tying the knot—it was about two cultures, two families, and two souls weaving their stories together
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | in the most dazzling way possible. The standout moment wasn’t just in the grand architecture or the designer fashions—it was in the smiles, the energy, and the love that filled every corner of the day. Ready for more jaw-dropping wedding inspiration? Follow us on Instagram and dive into stories that will leave you pinning, planning, and dreaming about your own big day. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? Zack and I met in college during our internship. We were good friends first, and talking to each other was so easy. We spent a lot of time together with our friends and eventually went on a date and have been together ever since. I knew he was the one when we were grocery shopping together after moving across the country. We had just moved in, and I remember
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | standing in the spice aisle and realizing I was having so much fun just getting groceries together. I knew if I could have fun with him at Ralph’s, I could enjoy the rest of my life with him. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Zack proposed to me on top of Mauna Kea on Hawaii’s Big Island. We went stargazing in the pitch black, and in the middle of my yapping and trying to identify stars in our Jeep (with the top down), he pulled the ring out. I was truly surprised, cried, and said yes. His number one goal was to make sure I had no idea it was coming, which is not an easy thing to do because I’m very nosy! He definitely succeeded. I was caught so off guard. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor The
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | me, and all of the other important details. Planning our wedding was a challenge because we wanted to make sure both our cultures and upbringings were represented. We had a two-day wedding, the Hindu ceremony at the BAPS temple in Chino Hills, and our American ceremony at Vellano Estate. It was important to us to make sure both venues were unique and allowed our guests to fully experience the ceremonies. We chose June 27 and 28th as our dates; my grandparents were married on June 28th for over 60 years. My Ajji passed away in 2022, and it was a small way of keeping her close. I know it was her dream to come to my wedding. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I’m from Bangalore, so I was always going to wear a silk saree for my Hindu
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Ceremony. My original plan was to wear my mom's saree and for my sister to wear our Ajji’s saree, but my mom's saree was heavily damaged. My parents went to India, and my dad had actually picked a beautiful pink saree for my mom in Mysore (where my mom grew up). When we realized I couldn’t wear my mom’s saree, she suggested the pink one. I loved that I had no input and my parents picked it for me, the color and thread work was so beautiful. I liked that the pink was unique to weddings, too. For my American ceremony, I chose the white Sasha Lehenga from Kynah. While I debated wearing a traditional American wedding dress, I still wanted both my cultures to be represented. I loved how unique the Lehenga was and knew it was the perfect blend of Indian and American. Both my outfits spoke to wh
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | o I am and how I was raised. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? Spending time together was my favorite part! Whether it was cake tasting or putting invites together, I loved the moments when it was just the two of us. We actually designed and created our invites from scratch. We went to the venues and took pictures, and had an artist from Etsy create them into watercolor paintings. We then used a template to create the invite, and my husband selected the paper, printed it out, and got a paper cutter to make them. I also got an illustrator to make stickers of our dogs, which I used on the belly bands. I told my husband my vision for the invites, and he truly made them a reality. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? On Friday, we had our
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | first friend we made in LA officiate, and only one person each in our bridal party, Zack’s best friend from college, and my sister. It was really special to us to have personal touches because without our friends, we wouldn’t have stayed on the West Coast. Guests loved that it was just a group of friends at the altar who truly knew us and could speak about our relationship. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? After our Hindu Ceremony, we were exhausted and took a minute in the bridal suite to just sit down. When we came out for lunch, everyone was almost done, and eventually the entire seating area was empty. We just sat there for a long time, the two of us, taking in the day. It was a quiet moment, and I remember looking around the templ
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | e and thinking we did it! Another moment is also after the Hindu Ceremony, our East Coast and West Coast friends went out to eat and drink. It was surreal seeing my entire friend group in one place. I felt so special. So many people took off work on a random Thursday and flew across the country for us! Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? One step at a time! It’s all very overwhelming, but once you remember everyone wants to celebrate you and your fiancé, everything becomes so much easier. I also didn’t eat very much because of nerves, so make sure you have simple snacks if you’re like me and hate attention! Darlings, want to see your wedding featured?
