Engage!25 Santa Barbara — Day 1 December 10, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Nestled along the sun-kissed shores of the American Riviera, Engage!25 Santa Barbara opened its doors with the signature magic, polish, and collaborative spirit that the Engage! Summits are known for. Hosted at the stunning Ritz-Carlton Bacara , Day 1 unfolded as a vibrant tapestry of luxe details, inspired design, and meaningful moments shared among the world’s top wedding and event professionals.

The Hilton Pearl River filled all of our check boxes, along with having so much charm and beautiful features. Abbey, our event coordinator, was amazing to work with from the start, and we would choose our venue 1000 times over. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? At first, I thought I would go straight away from the traditional red color, but after trying on multiple outfits, I understand why so many South Asian brides wear red. It was undeniable that it just makes you pop. My family and I went shopping in India, and one of the first designers I went to was Disha Patel, and I fell in love. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning proces

Of course, it was also amazing. Just see all of our planning come to life on the actual weekend of the wedding. Additionally, my family handmade the backdrop and decor we used for our haldi, so seeing that turn out so amazing was so satisfying. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? We had many people, on how amazing the food was, along with how our DJ did an amazing job, keeping the Dance floor hype. Shout out to Moghul Catering and Amplifire Entertainment! We also got a lot of love for our gift baskets, which my mom sourced from India. Was there a really special

SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ani & Jay’s feels like a beautifully bound novel—filled with plot twists, laughter, tradition, and page after page of pure heart. In fact, their entire wedding was inspired by the very idea of storytelling—a tribute to their tradition of scrapbooking every chapter of their lives together. And like any great book, their wedding was an experience you never want to put down. When it came time to celebrate, they wanted the wedding to feel like them —intentional, meaningful, and deeply reflective of their journey. And oh, did they deliver. The festivities began at the Marina del Rey Marriott , where the sangeet transformed into a “Storybook Sangeet”—a literal walk through a 10-foot open book featuring a poem Himani wrote . Guests flipped through six of their real scrapbooks before entering the
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ballroom, as if stepping inside the couple’s love story. Balerina Films captured the magic with their signature cinematic brilliance, turning each moment into a scene worthy of a fairytale film. Himani stunned in an emerald green and champagne Jigar and Nikita lehenga, her two emerald kalis—the “Hitched” design—symbolizing two souls standing out together amidst the world. Jay matched in a regal emerald sherwani. Her Bharatanatyam performance, honoring nine years of classical training, and a surprise reunion with her college Raas team created the kind of goosebump moments guests still talk about. Fusion Sounds , a proud Platinum Guide member, electrified the night with music that kept the dance floor packed until the very last beat. At home, the mehndi celebrations honored their Gujarati ro
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ots with a charming bandhani theme. Himani custom-designed every detail, wearing a backless bandhani corset with a traditional skirt as her family donned coordinated looks. Mehndi night followed, styled like a dreamy Jaipur bazaar—complete with playful banana décor. Himani glowed in mirror-work brilliance by Abhinav Mishra , every swirl of Mehndi by Masu’s artistry was captured beautifully in photos. The Grah Shanti ceremony held some of the most emotional moments of the week. Himani combined her mother’s wedding blouse and bangles with her grandmother’s sari, transformed into an elegant lehenga—anchoring the event in generations of love. Her grandmother’s wedding payals completed the meaningful tribute. For the boho-inspired pithi, Himani wore a neutral green Kalista palazzo set, layered
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | in seashell and pearl jewelry that danced with every move. Guests wore pink while she stood out in green—a perfect blend of tradition and personal expression. Old Ranch Country Club set the stage for a ceremony steeped in intention and individuality. Royal Ball Designs —masters of floral artistry and event design—created a soft, ethereal landscape of blooms and draping. Fusion Sounds set the musical ambiance, while Dheer’s energetic baraat rhythms had guests dancing in the streets. In the spirit of equality, Himani & Jay chose to each lead two pheras. They also chose to forgo Kanyadaan and Vidhai, honoring the belief that marriage is not about leaving one family behind, but uniting two. Himani wore a breathtaking white, pearl-encrusted lehenga from Rianta , paired with blush quartz and pea
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | rl jewelry. The reception at Marina del Rey Marriott was a modern monochrome dream—a grayscale rooftop celebration. Himani stunned in a bold, scarlet ISA by Dolly Wahal lehenga, hand-embroidered and fiery against the sea of white. Of course, every celebration needs its sweet moments; the venue delivered a stunning array of cake and treats, and Elite Magazine Photo Booth added a playful touch to capture everyone’s joy. And now, with this new chapter written, the scrapbooks will continue to grow—filled with memories, anniversaries, adventures, and a lifetime of love yet to be lived.

Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! My husband planned the most incredible proposal, one that I’ll cherish forever. Unbeknownst to me, he had been working on it for months, involving our family and closest friends. On the big day, my husband had arranged a full date: a fall outing to an arboretum followed by dinner at a restaurant we’d been wanting to try, near one of our favorite spots in the scenic Wissahickon Valley Park. This didn’t raise susp
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | icion—he often plans thoughtful outings—but I did wonder. That suspicion quickly vanished when our cat created a huge mess that delayed us for hours. I thought for sure he wouldn’t propose after that. We had a beautiful walk at the arboretum and arrived at the restaurant early, so we walked along the river's edge. As I stood watching the river, I turned around to find him on one knee. I was in complete shock, overwhelmed with joy, and said yes instantly! Then I noticed a stranger taking photos—he had hired a photographer to capture the moment and give us an impromptu engagement shoot. To top it off, our dinner included a surprise visit by our closest friends. It was the perfect day and evening, filled with love, laughter, and unforgettable memories. How did you select your bridal lengha or
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I feel so grateful that I was able to travel to New Delhi to select all of my bridal outfits. With my amazing mother-in-law and aunt-in-law guiding me through the bustling city and its many stores, they helped me discover all my stunning outfits and jewelry for the wedding event. Their support made the experience so special, and I know I wouldn’t have chosen such beautiful pieces without them. For my bridal lengha in particular, we stumbled upon it unexpectedly while shopping. I had originally envisioned a gold design, but the moment I tried on the velvety reddish-pink and cream ensemble with its intricate print, we all knew it was the one. The richness of the colors and the elegance of the detailing made it feel absolutely perfect. Wh

He was deeply involved in every decision, and together we shaped the vision for our wedding. He took the lead on vendor negotiations and managed countless day-of details while I was tied up with hours of hair and makeup. I love and admire how attentive he is, and how much he cares about making our wedding perfect. Seeing our dream celebration come to life was largely thanks to his efforts, and I’ll always cherish that. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? Our guests couldn’t stop raving about the food at all our events! We wanted the menu to reflect both of our backgrounds, so we had a mix of authentic Mexican and South
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Indian dishes. The flavors were vibrant, the variety was exciting, and everyone loved being able to try something new while also enjoying familiar favorites. We also had a hot, order churro cart during our reception for late-night dessert! The churro cart was a big hit! Beyond the food, people were struck by the vibrancy of our color palette and the beauty of our outfits. The rich, festive colors and elegant attire created such a joyful atmosphere that perfectly matched the celebration. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? Planning a wedding truly takes a village, and it’s important not to overwhelm yourself by trying to handle every detail alone. Ask for help to stay balanced, but also set boundaries so your vision isn’t overshadowed. We couldn’t have pulled everything off w

We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) We are so grateful to the incredible people who helped bring our wedding to life.

SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | TWEET: PIN: Merida, MX Indian Wedding by The Wedding Filmer December 5, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some weddings make you smile. Some weddings make you cry. And then there’s Aayush & Suman’s wedding—a celebration so cinematic, so soul-stirring, and so beautifully human that you will find yourself smiling, crying, and pausing every few seconds just to whisper, “Wow… that actually happened.” When The Wedding Filmer takes the lead on cinematography, magic isn’t a possibility—it’s a guarantee. And this celebration at the lush Hacienda San Pedro Ochil was nothing short of breathtaking. From the start, the visuals feel like a love poem in motion. Two grooms, two hearts, two families merging into one story framed by towering palms, warm island light, and the rustic elegance of the Hacienda’s
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | old-world architecture. The Wedding Filmer , a powerhouse featured team known for crafting films that feel like intimate documentaries rather than staged productions, captured every moment with the tenderness and grandeur it deserved. Their signature style—raw, emotional, poetic—turned Aayush & Suman’s journey into a work of art. They are undoubtedly masters of their craft, having redefined what wedding movies can be. But they weren’t alone. Sahed Photography , Ashish Sawhny , Raj Sampad , and Addy Khanna joined forces behind the lens, turning this wedding into what can only be described as the Avengers-level collaboration of South Asian cinematography. Every angle, every tear, every hand squeeze, every laugh—it all found its place in a tapestry of beautifully crafted frames. Photographer
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Judson Rappaport added her own layer of storytelling with rich editorial stills that captured the grooms in their quiet moments: adjusting their tuxes, exchanging glances, and smiling like two people who know they’ve just won at life. Hacienda San Pedro Ochil provided the perfect setting for every chapter of this celebration—from sangeet to ceremony to a reception that glowed under strings of lights and the warm Mexican night. The wedding planning was a blast thanks to Emmanuel Vega Events , who really understood everything they needed and handled the planning and design with enviable ease, transforming the historic estate into a celebration where modern aesthetics met soulful tradition. Minimal Estudio complemented the natural surroundings with floral arrangements that were artistic with
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | out ever feeling overdone. Think greenery that felt organic and effortless, soft blooms tucked into stone corners, and details that whispered elegance rather than shouting it. The mandap was decorated with kaleere, a tradition that Aayush grew up with. The grooms looked every bit the modern style icons in ensembles by Bobo Calcutta , Siddartha Tytler , and Parama —design houses that know how to create fashion with equal parts edge, culture, and sophistication. Their sleek tuxedos from Philocaly Menswear completed the transformation, blending bold personal style with timeless tailoring. Makeup by Veronica Galvan ensured both grooms glowed (we’re not saying dewy perfection, but… yes, dewy perfection), and Mehndi by Veronica added a touch of artistic tradition that felt personal and deeply me
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | aningful. The sounds of the night were curated by DJ Robert Firth , who kept the energy both elevated and intimate—perfectly matching the emotional tone of the films. At the reception, guests dined on exquisite dishes by Margo Amalia , a culinary artist whose flavors transported everyone straight into a sensory love story. Every plate was a reflection of the joy being celebrated. And through it all, The Wedding Filmer captured a story that wasn’t just about two people getting married—it was about love choosing courage—family choosing acceptance. Community choosing celebration. The wedding film reflects all of it: the unfiltered emotion, the laughter between friends, the tenderness in vows, the electric reception energy, and the quiet moments where the world seemed to pause just for Aayush
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | & Suman. If you’re ready to fall in love all over again, watch their film and immerse yourself in the beauty of what happens when the right couple meets the perfect creative team. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? We met in medical school in India. I (Aayush) made the first move —I found Suman walking around campus and said I liked his artwork, though he didn't really pay much attention (or maybe he secretly did). But I did not give up, and eight months later, we were dating. In Suman’s version, it took Aayush eight months to get the hint that Suman was already head over heels in love. We like to think of our love as a first date that never ends, despite the challenges of long distances spanning years and sometimes continents. Somehow, despite the distance
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | that often separated us during our years of medical training, we grew closer together. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! After making Aayush wait for over a decade, Suman planned a surprise proposal in Central Park, New York. He brought Aayush along with the pretense of meeting their closest friends for their son's photoshoot, except that the lens was waiting for the two of them. There, in front of Bethesda fountain, Suman went down on one knee (in white trousers!), and Aayush went speechless for the only time in his life. For the proposal, Suman designed the engagement ring with a marquis diamond to represents ‘A’ and a tension setting to represent ‘S’, thus combining their names in eternity. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Ven
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. As we started planning the wedding, we knew that we wanted to incorporate details that were unique to our lives. Aayush had always wanted to have a traditional wedding where all family and friends gather together in a big family home to celebrate over lovely songs, ancient rituals and endless cups of chai. Suman, ever the romantic, loved the idea of a historic home with large gardens and majestic trees. Haciendas in Merida fit the bill perfectly and we left it to our wonderful wedding planner Emm to find the perfect spot! We wanted our guests to feel like they were coming home. In a time when we are all scattered across the globe, we wanted everyone to be able to come together and feel a part of a family. And
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | , over the course of the weekend, we did all become one family. We trusted our planner Emm to find vendors who would understand our vision and he found the perfect team. Everyone, the design team, catering, DJ and venue staff, saw the beauty in our story and were genuinely happy for us. We knew they are the experts in their crafts and we let them create their magic, which was the best decision! Memories are important to us, so we brought along our amazing photographer Judson from New York (who captured our proposal) and our dream videographers, The Wedding Filmer, from India. How did you select your wedding outfit? Did you have a favorite color in mind? We sourced our wedding outfits from India to reflect our love for the rich textile heritage that we grew up with. We both do not follow ge
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | nder norms in our style and we chose androgynous looks for our wedding day as it best represented us. Aayush wore a couture Anarkali style outfit in dusky pink with old gold trim by Siddhartha Tytler. Suman wore a traditional lehenga and angrakha designed by Fauzia Khan which featured Chikankari and Mukaish. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? The wedding planning was a blast for us. Thanks to our planner Emmanuel Vega (Emm) who really understood us, we got to enjoy every little bit of the process. All of our vendors paid personal attention to making our dreams come true. One of the most enjoyable parts was our initial trip to Merida, Mexico with Emm and his team - not only did Emm plan every part of our trip, he also helped us navigate the myriad decisions a

Our caterers, even though they had never cooked Indian food, did such a wonderful job learning our culture and even brought out the spices for us to approve at the tasting. And of course, shopping for outfits in India is an adventure we would never forget, It spanned three cities and countless trials and we loved every bit of it. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? The venues! The lovingly tended gardens all around us, the beautiful table settings that the staff put together each day, the Oxacan candles, honey liqueur Xtabentun, and rattan fans that Emmanuel (our planner) and the design team sourced from across Mexico, each little detailed made the time that muc
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | h more magical. Throughout the few days, our guests (and us) loved that so many of the elements were handcrafted and represented us in both planned and unplanned ways. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? For Suman, it was watching Aayush come down the aisle slowly, and then midway realizing that the slow walk is not for him so he literally sprints down the steps toward me (Suman) with the most beautiful smile on his face – that is my most cherished memory. For me (Aayush), it was the first look in the light of a candle (Shubho-drishti, in Bengali tradition) where I saw Suman in his intricately embroidered Chikankari lehenga with traditional Bengali bridal eye makeup, covering his face with his hands (which had betel leaves design henna on
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | his hands) – truly like Bengal Royalty! For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. One of the special touches to our wedding was the gender fluidity in the customs. The wedding altar (mandap) was decorated with kaleere - jewelry that traditionally adorns the wrists of a Punjabi bride and symbolizes good wishes from her family- a tradition that Aayush grew up with. Unconventionally for a groom, Aayush also wore a pair of Kaleere on the wedding day, decorated with individual charms that his closest friends, family, and Suman had picked out for him, including a blue door to represent Suman’s dorm room, their safe place.
