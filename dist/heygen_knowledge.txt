Antigua Guatemala, GT Fusion Wedding by Naba Zabih November 27, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments When Umbar & Yash first crossed paths as 18-year-old freshmen at the University of Florida, their shared passion for dance quickly sparked a connection. As co-captains of the GatoRaas dance team, their bond deepened, but their journey toward marriage wasn’t without challenges. With Indian, Pakistani, and Panamanian roots intertwining, they navigated complex family dynamics over ten years, patiently earning blessings from both sides. Their decade-long journey culminated in a magical proposal in August 2023
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | . Yash led Umbar on a serene hike to an intimate cave where sunlight poured in, just so illuminating the moment as he asked for her hand. Weeks later, surrounded by family, they celebrated their nikkah ceremony, marking the official beginning of their life together. After just eleven months of planning, Umbar and Yash brought their vision to life with a breathtaking four-day fusion wedding in colonial Antigua, Guatemala. The festivities began with “Infinite Blessings,” a baraat on a hilltop overlooking the city, where Guatemalan drummers set the rhythm and the couple exchanged pheras against a backdrop of ancient volcanoes. Day two, “Party in Pana,” whisked 120 guests to Lake Atitlán. A “love boat” cruise offered explorations of local villages, coffee and chocolate tastings, and a lakeside

The highlight was “Dancing in the Moonlight”—a sangeet held at the historic amphitheater La Ermita de Santa Cruz. Over 200 guests danced under the stars to electrifying beats, capped by a surprise fireworks show perfectly choreographed to John Summit’s “Shiver.” The grand finale, “Happy Ending,” featured a heartfelt civil ceremony at Convento Capuchinas, followed by a lively parade through Antigua’s cobblestone streets with drummers and saxophonists leading the way. The reception at La Casa de la Ruina Santa Rosa dazzled guests with surprise dance performances, emotional speeches, and a wild “Hora Loca” celebration complete with playful props and bobblehead cameos of Bad Bunny and Lionel Messi.

Love Beyond Boundaries: An Indian-Pakistani-Panamanian Fusion Wedding in Antigua, Guatemala A Decade in the Making When Umbar and Yash first met as 18-year-old freshmen at the University of Florida, neither could have predicted the beautiful journey that lay ahead. Brought together by their shared passion for dance as members of GatoRaas, their relationship truly blossomed in 2015 when they became co-captains of the team. Though they gravitated toward each other naturally, their path to matrimony wasn'

Coming from different religious and cultural backgrounds—Indian, Pakistani, and Panamanian—meant navigating complex family dynamics that tested their resolve. While some family members embraced their relationship from the start, others needed time to come to terms with their union. After a decade of patience and perseverance, the couple finally received blessings from both families, allowing them to plan a celebration that honored their mutual love of dance, food, music, and joyful energy. The long-awaited proposal came in August 2023, when Yash led Umbar to an intimate cave at the end of a dreamy hike. As sunlight streamed perfectly into the cave, illuminating the moment as if orchestrated by fate itself, he asked for her hand in marriage. Just weeks later, both famil

A Four-Day Celebration in Colonial Antigua After just eleven months of planning, Umbar and Yash's dream fusion wedding unfolded across four spectacular days in Antigua, Guatemala. Day one, aptly named "Infinite Blessings," took place on a mountainous hilltop overlooking the colonial city. The festivities began with Yash's lively baraat, enhanced by the rhythmic flair of local Guatemalan drummers. As the sun painted the sky in amber hues, the couple completed their pheras surrounded by close family and friends all dressed in ivory, creating a scene of ethereal beauty against the backdrop of ancient volcanoes.

The third day, "Dancing in the Moonlight," was the bride and groom's favorite—a testament to the passion for dance that first brought them together. The historic amphitheater-style monument, La Ermita de Santa Cruz, transformed into a vibrant sangeet venue where 200+ guests danced under the stars. The night reached its crescendo with a surprise fireworks display choreographed to John Summit's "Shiver," before everyone boarded traditional chicken buses back to their hotels. The grand f

The reception at La Casa de la Ruina Santa Rosa featured surprise dance performances, including ones the couple had secretly prepared for each other.

SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Comments Payal & Elvis’s love story is full of heartfelt moments and surprises, culminating in a vibrant Indian wedding set against the stunning backdrop of Punta Cana’s turquoise beaches. The journey began in 2014 when they started dating, and from early on, Aruba held a special place in their hearts. On their first Christmas together, Elvis gifted Payal plane tickets to Aruba—turning their dream vacation into a cherished memory. Fast forward eight years, and Elvis planned the ultimate surprise: a proposal at the very same romantic beachside restaurant where their first vacation began. On June 22, 2022—exactly eight years after they first dated—Elvis got down on one knee as a photographer “captured” the moment, with the Caribbean sunset lighting their path toward forever. Planning a dest

The team they chose made every detail seamless, from their travel agent’s expert guidance to their wedding planner, Luisa’s flawless execution at Dreams Macao Beach Punta Cana . Payal’s hair and makeup artist kept her glowing despite the Caribbean heat, and the DJ flawlessly curated the soundtrack for every event, blending cultural beats with island vibes. When it came to her bridal look, Payal surprised herself by embracing red—a traditional wedding color she hadn’t worn before. A friend’s discovery of a stunning lengha from India sealed the decision, and Payal radiated elegance in a look that was both traditional and true to her. What truly stood out to guests was the immersive

Over three days, guests enjoyed vibrant ceremonies, lively dancing, and a delicious fusion of Indian and Caribbean flavors. Payal and Elvis crafted an atmosphere where everyone felt like they were on a joyous vacation rather than just attending a wedding. One moment forever etched in Payal’s heart was her walk down the aisle, carrying a framed photo of her late father. As a prayer was said in his honor, a sudden Caribbean rain shower felt like a beautiful, spiritual blessing—turning a bittersweet moment into one filled with love and presence.

Early on, he asked me what one place I’d love to visit, and without hesitation, I said “Aruba.” That Christmas, he surprised me with plane tickets to Aruba, making it our very first vacation together—a memory I’ve cherished ever since. Fast forward eight years later: while I was away at a friend’s bachelorette party, Elvis called to tell me he had planned a weekend getaway… back to Aruba! As we finalized plans, I told him I wanted to recreate a photo we had taken at a romantic restaurant there called Passions on the Beach, completely unaware that he had much bigger plans in mind. In June 2022, we returned to Aruba. On June 22, 2022—exactly eight years to the day since we started datin

I refused to walk back with him because I was in high heels—little did I know he was actually going back for the ring he had hidden there! When we arrived, a “restaurant photographer” approached us, saying she was taking pictures for their marketing materials and asked if we wanted to participate. Completely clueless, I agreed. She had us pose together, then asked me to pose alone. And while I was smiling for the camera, Elvis got down on one knee behind me. When I turned around, there he was, asking me to marry him with the Caribbean sunset as our backdrop. It was magical, emotional, and perfect in every way—a full-circle moment eight years in th

Being a wedding coordinator also made planning a destination wedding feel smooth and intentional. All of our vendors made everything so easy.

I didn’t even do a trial—I just knew she was the one who’d make me look my best throughout every event. After our first night (Sangeet), it was super hot and humid, and the next day guests kept asking if I even sweat because my makeup was still flawless. She made sure my hair and makeup were on point from start to finish. Music can make or break a celebration, and our DJ nailed it from the first call. We never once had to ask for a change—he understood our vibe and kept every event flowing with the perfect mix.

I’ve never been someone who wears red—I always felt like it didn’t suit me. But for my wedding day, I knew I wanted a traditional look, so I kept an open mind. I tried on several red lenghas at a local wedding boutique here in New Jersey. Some of them were beautiful, but none of them truly felt like the one. Then one day, a friend of mine was scrolling through a shop in India and came across a stunning red lengha she thought I’d love. She sent it to me, and the moment I saw it, I knew. Even though red wasn’t a color I usually wore, this lengha felt perfect for my wedding day. I wore red for the first time, and I absolutely loved how everything came together—it was tradit

For so many of our guests, our wedding was full of firsts—especially for my husband’s side of the family. It was their first traditional Indian wedding, their first destination wedding, and for some, even the first wedding they had ever attended! What they loved most was how interactive and immersive the entire experience was. Over three days, we had multiple events, each with its own energy, theme, and style—colorful outfits, upbeat music, delicious food, and lively dancing. Guests had the chance to fully experience the richness of Indian culture while also enjoying the beauty of a Caribbean vacation. They loved that each event felt unique: the Welcome Night brought everyone together, the Grah Shanti and

Guests kept telling us how much they enjoyed dressing up for different events, dancing to a mix of Bollywood and Latin music, and eating food that blended cultures together beautifully. What made us happiest to hear was that no one ever felt tired or “weddinged-out.” Instead, they felt like they were on a three-day getaway with friends and family—celebrating, laughing, relaxing by the beach, and creating memories that went far beyond a typical wedding weekend. It was exactly the atmosphere we hoped to create. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? One moment that replays in my mind over and over again is my walk down

But after losing him in 2022, I knew he wouldn’t be there physically. To honor him, I carried a framed photo of him as I walked toward the mandap. It was my way of bringing him with me into this new chapter of my life. After Elvis and I exchanged garlands, the priest offered a special prayer for my dad. As he placed the tilak on my dads photo, the skies suddenly opened, and it began to rain. We were on a Caribbean island where, the entire week before and after the wedding, the weather had been perfect—sunny skies, no rain in sight. The only rainfall came at that very moment, during the prayer for my dad. For me, it wasn’t just a coincidence—it felt like my dad was

Shikha choreographed most of the evening and performed in nearly half the dances herself—her energy lighting up the stage. Events By Vaishali , the creative force behind the wedding’s seamless flow, transformed every space into a reflection of elegance and celebration. The décor by Par
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | tyland Sajawat was a feast for the senses. Sachi didn’t just bring a vision to life—she turned Pinterest dreams into an experience even more breathtaking than imagined. When the big day arrived, the Four Seasons Hotel Baltimore became the stage for Shikha & Vipul’s stunning ceremony overlooking the harbor, with sunlight streaming in like a divine blessing. Shikha, radiant in a handcrafted Nitika Gujral ensemble, exuded grace and modern Maharani allure. Her bridal glow was perfected by Style by Susmita , whose calm, artistic touch made every moment effortlessly elegant. From her intricate Om Sons Bridal Store jewelry to her serene smile, every detail spoke of joy and confidence. Vipul’s grand baraat—led by Premier Entertainment —was pure celebration. His procession danced its way from the B
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | altimore Marriott Waterfront to the Four Seasons, framed by the sparkling Inner Harbor. In a special twist, Shikha made a surprise cameo from a terrace overlooking the lively crowd, a cinematic prelude to their vows. Their ceremony music by Pavan Verma added a soulful layer to the moment. He played “Madhanya” on the flute as Shikha made her entrance, filling the air with emotion. The ceremony itself was filled with laughter, reverence, and the kind of heartfelt glances that make time stand still. The ballroom shimmered under chandeliers, with a custom dance floor by GoToShout setting the stage for nonstop revelry. Premier Entertainment once again kept the energy alive, ensuring guests danced until the very last beat. Culinary perfection came courtesy of Moghul Catering , who honored both P
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | unjabi and Telugu traditions with exquisite dishes that had guests raving long after the weekend ended. But what truly set this wedding apart was its warmth. Despite the grandeur, every moment felt deeply personal—woven together with family, intention, and love. Shikha credits her parents for being her ultimate teammates: her mother’s calm wisdom and her father’s logistical brilliance turned planning into a family art form. From late-night checklist sessions to “Tetris-packing” a moving truck, every bit of this wedding was built with heart. And of course, every stunning second was immortalized by Nayeem Vohra Photography , whose artistry turned fleeting emotions into timeless treasures. From Bhavna’s Henna -adorned hands to every dance floor spin, their lens captured the soul of the celebr
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ation. From heartfelt vows to sangeet sparkle, this Baltimore wedding was more than an event—it was a celebration of two souls intertwining, a masterclass in blending North and South Indian cultures with style, substance, and sincerity. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? We met the good old-fashioned way...reaching for the same jalapeno in a grocery store.. Just kidding, we met on a dating app called Coffee Meets Bagel! After we matched, instead of small talk about the weather & our favorite colors, he immediately messaged asking to meet in person at a really cute cocktail bar in Philly called One Tippling Place. Our first date had some eavesdroppers who were sitting next to us & when he went to the restroom, they tapped me on the shoulder and were shocked
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | that we were only on a first date! Even though it was a "school night," we closed the bar down & the rest was history. Even though I'll never admit it to him, I knew he was the one pretty early on. I was in my GI fellowship at the time which can be really demanding, and he was endlessly supportive. From the start, we dated with intention. Every conversation, including the serious ones, only brought us closer. Nothing scared him off & if anything, it made us both even more excited for what was to come! Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. We actually started planning our wedding before we were even engaged! Having attended so many weddings together, we quick
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ly became experts in what worked (and what we’d do differently). Through those experiences, we organically discovered many of our own vendors. We started a little backward by hunting for venues first. After touring multiple options, we ultimately chose a beautiful location at the Inner Harbor in Baltimore - perfectly situated between both sides of our families. Our vision was for everyone to move into the hotel for the entire weekend so that it felt like one big family reunion rather than a series of separate events. We did everything but the wedding ceremony at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, which is where all our guests were staying. The baraat was super fun since it walked my husband's side from the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, where they were staying, to the wedding venue at the
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Four Seasons with the backdrop of the Inner Harbor! I even got to pop out of one of the Four Seasons' terraces that overlooked the baraat walk for a quick cameo!! By the time we found our wedding planner - Events By Vaishali, we already had the venue booked - but she was truly our saving grace. Her team coordinated every vendor, handled all the moving parts, and, most importantly, ensured the weekend ran seamlessly. I was able to completely hand over my stress (and my phone!) to them and just be present during the weekend. It wasn’t until after the weekend that I learned about all the little fires they’d quietly put out behind the scenes like true professionals. Our planner also introduced me to my makeup artist, Style By Susmita, with whom I connected instantly. She has such a gift for en
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | hancing your natural beauty and creating a calm, grounded energy - which is so important, especially since you spend more time with your hair and makeup team than almost anyone else during the wedding weekend! My planner also introduced me to my mehndi artist, who was equally incredible. We did a long Zoom consultation where she designed my patterns on an iPad. She spent over nine hours doing my full bridal mehndi but kept up the most positive, warm energy the entire time - it felt more like spending the day with a close friend than with a vendor. Our decorator, Sachi from PartylandSajawa, turned from vendor to fast friend. She completely understood our vision and brought it to life with such attention to detail. Each event felt so distinct yet cohesive. She had this rare ability to take m
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | y Pinterest dreams and translate them into something even more beautiful than I imagined. Our photographer was Nayeem Vohra, whom I met at my best friend's wedding over 5 years ago. I knew from that moment that he was going to be my photographer before I even had a man or a date selected. The universe was in my favor that he happened to be free! His team has an incredible way of making you feel comfortable in front of the camera, and he always gets the best shot! Our caterer was Mogul Catering, which was out of this world! I am Punjabi, and my husband is Telugu so it was important for us to both have our cultures represented. During our tasting, Mogul made sure to have us try special dishes from both parts of India and absolutely came through during our weekend. Our guests could not stop r
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | aving about it!! As a dancer, our musical talent was of the utmost importance. We used Premier DJs, HR Beats, and Ambition. They knew the vibe we needed for all four events, and we didn't have a single repeated song all weekend! Our planner also recommended Pawan Varma, who is a flautist & saxophonist. He brought such a unique energy to our baraat, wedding & reception. He played "Madhanya" on his flute for my bridal entrance and played saxophone covers of all our favorite Bollywood songs during the baraat & cocktail hour! The outfit process was a whirlwind! We traveled to India for just a few days, so I had to make every minute count. I had done tons of research beforehand, but between choosing my own looks and helping my sister find hers, it was an adventure. Susmita, my makeup artist, wa
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s incredibly helpful even from afar, guiding me to pick outfits that complemented one another while still being unique for each event. Special shout-out to both my parents who never left my side during the shopping marathon. We also got a chance to custom make our bridal party outfits with Meetu Makkad in Shahpur Jat, which was such a cool & unique process! And finally, the heart of it all, my family. My mom was my rock throughout the entire planning process. Together, we mastered the Notes app like pros, creating shared to-do lists and weekly check-ins with every detail meticulously tracked. My mom had this magical way of balancing logistics and emotions - she kept us organized, grounded and laughing through it all. Every little moment of our wedding had its fingerprints on it, from the t
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | iniest décor details to the thoughtful guest experiences. My dad was instrumental in execution, helping us expertly pack inventory into bins in the months leading up to everything, and Tetris packing a huge moving truck without missing a single piece. It truly became a family project filled with so much love, teamwork, and joy. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? The best part of the planning process was doing it together. We only had 6 months from our proposal to our wedding day, but we got through it all together! Things can definitely get stressful at times since there are so many moving parts but having each other through it all made it feel fun and meaningful. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? The wed
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ding weekend goes by in a complete blur - everyone tells you that, but you don’t really believe it until you’re in it. For me, the one moment that felt like time actually stopped was in between our wedding ceremony and reception. Vipul and I had about an hour completely to ourselves, and it was the first time all weekend that things felt quiet. We just sat together, taking it all in - everything we’d planned, everyone we loved, and the fact that we were finally married. It reminded me that all of it, the planning, the details, the celebration,s was ultimately for these moments together. Overall, the entire weekend was a special moment. Flashbacks of all our family & friends having the time of their life on the dance floor and eating biriyani & gol gappe will live in my heart forever! Weavi

For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. As a lifelong dancer, the Sangeet was especially close to my heart. I choreographed almost the entire evening and somehow still found myself performing in nearly half the dances! It was one of the most fun parts of the whole wedding weekend. Seeing our family and friends pour so much love, energy, and enthusiasm into every performance was incredibly special. Vipul & I also did a special performance that mixed the Hindi & the Telugu versions of Chaleya/Chalona together! Ready to feel inspired, maharanis?
