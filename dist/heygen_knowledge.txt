Some are emotional. And then there’s Vaishnavi & Parth’s wedding —a cinematic, architectural love letter to San Francisco that somehow made the whole city feel like it had RSVP’d “yes.” From the first frame to the final farewell, every moment felt like it could have been pulled straight from a magaz
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ine cover… which is exactly why Lesya Ababakumova Photography (with her unmistakable editorial eye) was the perfect photographer to bring this story to life. Her lens didn’t just document—it narrated, translated, and elevated, turning candid moments into fine-art portraits against the city’s iconic skyline. The celebration began at the historic Ferry Building for a sangeet that looked like a modern Indian soirée dipped in golden hour magic. Under its soaring archways, Vaishnavi arrived wrapped in jewel-tone elegance, shimmering in the soft evening glow , while Parth matched her energy with that effortless “groom who knows he’s winning at life” confidence. Friends and family filled the hall with music, laughter, and choreography worthy of a Bollywood award category. NC Event Designs transfo

The following morning, San Francisco’s Financial District got the wake-up call of a lifetime. Parth’s baraat burst through the streets with dhol beats echoing between skyscrapers, turning the city into a living soundbox. Office workers peered out of windows. Tourists pulled out their phones. Dogs barked in supportive confusion. And there was Parth—absolutely in his element—as his procession danced through the crosswalks like they owned the zip code. City View at Metreon lived up to its name and then some. With panoramic skyline views framing the mandap, the ceremony became an ode not just to traditi

NC Event Designs crafted a floral and décor experience that was equal parts modern simplicity and serene beauty— clean lines, monochrome florals, and airy draping that allowed the skyline to be the true showstopper. Lesya's portraits in this space? Insanely gorgeous. The kind you stare at and think, “This belongs in a gallery… or at least as my phone wallpaper.” The reception followed, embracing a minimalist palette inspired by the Indian monsoon season—soft blues, smoky greys, rain-washed greens, and a cascade of candlelit warmth. The room looked like a modern poem: moody, atmospheric, and intentionally understated so that every moment, every embrace, and every dance step became the focal point. One of the most touching layers of the celeb
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ration came from behind the camera. Parth, a wedding videographer himself, entrusted his own team—including Tagironva Weddings and Parth Productions —to step into the storyteller role he is so often responsible for. It was a beautiful exchange of trust, respect, and artistic camaraderie. The result was a visual narrative that felt deeply personal, as though every clip was filmed with the same love the couple shares. From iconic architecture to intimate traditions, from sweeping skylines to tiny emotional details caught between vows, Vaishnavi & Parth’s celebration honored the heart of Indian weddings while boldly embracing contemporary design and city life. It was modern yet meaningful, grand yet grounded, refined yet joyfully chaotic in the way only big Indian families can achieve. We hop

We decided to go all in on our relationship and try long distance, and after 6 long years of FaceTime calls and plane rides, we’re finally in the same city and married! Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Dev and I had dinner plans in NYC, but with my family, he planned for brunch in Hoboken, which I made the reservation for! When we got to the restaurant, my parents and sister drove away and Dev took me to the waterfront where he proposed. He had a photographer set up! After a photoshoot, he arranged for a dinner surprise with both of our families and a night out surprise with our friends from all over! It was a perfect night. Tell us how you went about planning your
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. My family, Dev, and I started wedding planning from the jump. We researched numerous venues and were Excel sheet obsessed with all of the budgets and vendors we were interested in. Dev really wanted a venue that also had a hotel, so all of our friends and family traveling had an easy weekend logistically, and I really wanted an outdoor wedding. The Hilton Pearl River filled all of our check boxes, along with having so much charm and beautiful features. Abbey, our event coordinator, was amazing to work with from the start, and we would choose our venue 1000 times over. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ? At first, I thought I would go straight away from the traditional red color, but after trying on multiple outfits, I understand why so many South Asian brides wear red. It was undeniable that it just makes you pop. My family and I went shopping in India, and one of the first designers I went to was Disha Patel, and I fell in love. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? The most enjoyable part of the process was how it brought my family closer together, and all of the time we spent together and finding all of the details that made it really feel so special to us. Of course, it was also amazing. Just see all of our planning come to life on the actual weekend of the wedding. Additionally, my family handmade the backdrop and decor we used for our haldi, so seeing
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | that turn out so amazing was so satisfying. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? We had many people, on how amazing the food was, along with how our DJ did an amazing job, keeping the Dance floor hype. Shout out to Moghul Catering and Amplifire Entertainment! We also got a lot of love for our gift baskets, which my mom sourced from India. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? It’s hard to pick one special moment, but just seeing all of our favorite people together in one place was so special. Some highlights were the amazing performances our friends and family put together for our sangeet and dancing with everyone at the reception. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be?

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Seal Beach, CA Gujarati Wedding by Balerina Films December 9, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments If some love stories feel like poetry, Himani & Jay’s feels like a beautifully bound novel—filled with plot twists, laughter, tradition, and page after page of pure heart. In fact, their entire wedding was inspired by the very idea of storytelling—a tribute to their tradition of scrapbooking every chapter of their lives together. And like any great book, their wedding was an experience you never want to put down. When it came time to celebrate, the
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | y wanted the wedding to feel like them —intentional, meaningful, and deeply reflective of their journey. And oh, did they deliver. The festivities began at the Marina del Rey Marriott , where the sangeet transformed into a “Storybook Sangeet”—a literal walk through a 10-foot open book featuring a poem Himani wrote . Guests flipped through six of their real scrapbooks before entering the ballroom, as if stepping inside the couple’s love story. Balerina Films captured the magic with their signature cinematic brilliance, turning each moment into a scene worthy of a fairytale film. Himani stunned in an emerald green and champagne Jigar and Nikita lehenga, her two emerald kalis—the “Hitched” design—symbolizing two souls standing out together amidst the world. Jay matched in a regal emerald sher

Her Bharatanatyam performance, honoring nine years of classical training, and a surprise reunion with her college Raas team created the kind of goosebump moments guests still talk about. Fusion Sounds , a proud Platinum Guide member, electrified the night with music that kept the dance floor packed until the very last beat. At home, the mehndi celebrations honored their Gujarati roots with a charming bandhani theme. Himani custom-designed every detail, wearing a backless bandhani corset with a traditional skirt as her family donned coordinated looks. Mehndi night followed, styled like a dreamy Jaipur bazaar—complete with playful banana décor. Himani glowed in mirror-work brilliance by Abhinav Mishra , every swirl of Mehndi by Masu’s artistry was captured beautifully in photos. The Gr

Himani combined her mother’s wedding blouse and bangles with her grandmother’s sari, transformed into an elegant lehenga—anchoring the event in generations of love. Her grandmother’s wedding payals completed the meaningful tribute. For the boho-inspired pithi, Himani wore a neutral green Kalista palazzo set, layered in seashell and pearl jewelry that danced with every move. Guests wore pink while she stood out in green—a perfect blend of tradition and personal expression. Old Ranch Country Club set the stage for a ceremony steeped in intention and individuality. Royal Ball Designs —masters of floral artistry and event design—created a soft, ethereal landscape of blooms and draping. Fusion Sounds set the musical ambianc

They also chose to forgo Kanyadaan and Vidhai, honoring the belief that marriage is not about leaving one family behind, but uniting two. Himani wore a breathtaking white, pearl-encrusted lehenga from Rianta , paired with blush quartz and pearl jewelry. The reception at Marina del Rey Marriott was a modern monochrome dream—a grayscale rooftop celebration. Himani stunned in a bold, scarlet ISA by Dolly Wahal lehenga, hand-embroidered and fiery against the sea of white.
