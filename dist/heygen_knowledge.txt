COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Riviera Maya, MX Fusion Wedding by Ruben Chan Photo October 23, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Minal & Navin’s wedding wasn’t just a celebration; it was a full-on spectacle of love, laughter, and the kind of glamour that makes you wonder if Netflix missed out by not turning it into a limited series. With the turquoise waves of the Carib
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | bean as their backdrop, this wedding proved that when you blend South Asian traditions with Riviera Maya luxury, the result is pure magic. Every event unfolded at the breathtaking Generations Riviera Maya , a resort that knows exactly how to host a wedding with grandeu r. From the lively sangeet where guests danced like nobody was watching (though plenty of cameras were), to a ceremony kissed by ocean breezes, to a reception that shimmered under Riviera Maya starlight, the venue was a character in the love story. Guiding the vision from concept to curtain call was Flawless Destination Weddings . True to their name, they delivered a seamless experience that wove culture, creativity, and coastal chic into one unforgettable tapestry. Of course, no bride walks down the aisle without the perfec
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | t look, and Alex Corbanezi worked his artistry to ensure Minal was glowing brighter than the Riviera sunset. Paired with intricate designs by Loto Mehndi , her look transitioned effortlessly from sangeet sparkle to ceremonial grace, leaving everyone enchanted. The rituals themselves were anchored with heart and authenticity by Pandit Bernardo Soriano. And then there was the music—because what’s a South Asian wedding without a dance floor that never rests? DJ Kid Kesh had every generation, from aunties to toddlers, showing off their best moves (and maybe a few questionable ones too). Guests needed little encouragement to turn the reception into an all-out dance party. Behind the lens, Ruben Chan Photo turned fleeting moments into forever memories. His ability to capture not just the grand,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | sweeping beauty of Riviera Maya but also the small, intimate glances between Minal and Navin is nothing short of artistry. His cinematography brought cinematic flair, ensuring the couple will relive their vows, their laughs, and their wild bhangra moves for decades to come. For those traveling from afar, the logistics were flawless thanks to Indian Destination Wedding , whose expertise in crafting seamless journeys for guests made all the difference. From booking the best flights to ensuring guests were sipping cocktails by the pool instead of waiting in airport lines, they set the gold standard for destination wedding hospitality. It’s not just about getting you to the wedding—it’s about making the journey part of the celebration itself, and they nailed it. This was a living, breathing ma
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | sterpiece of love and luxury, proof that South Asian weddings thrive when tradition meets destination elegance. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? We swiped, of course! Is there any other way? Navin first swiped right on Hinge, but I left him with a non-response (to think we could have gotten this marriage done way sooner). I ended up on Coffee Meets Bagel after a while, and he had swiped right on there too (apparently, boys just swipe on every girl on every app). I decided to give the poor guy a chance. We texted back and forth for a while, and finally he asked me out on a date. I was so certain this would not work out because he was everything I thought I didn’t want. However, I kept an open mind and gave it a chance. He found a Mexican restaurant in Down
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ey, California, for a rainy Saturday night. The planner in me had to look up everything about the restaurant, and I was even more sure this wouldn’t work. The cheap Gujju in me decided not to take on their valet-only parking and parked next door at Shakey’s. I also found that they charge $4 for water. He was going to be too bougie for my taste. So, I get to the restaurant, and he grabs us a table (and orders not 1, but 2 of those $4 waters and 2 drinks when we said we’d share one because he didn’t have the nerve to tell me he doesn’t like mojitos). The conversation went on and, well… to my surprise, we hit it off. Time went by, and I felt like I could be myself. Basically, he won me over. He even got plus points for taking home the awesome water bottle, which I somehow forgot to take. Don’
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | t get too happy, though; he paid for valet and had to get his own car out. We decided to grab some drinks nearby and drove around to find that we weren’t in the best of neighborhoods, so we sat in the car in the Shakey’s parking lot and talked for over an hour (while he left his car on with little gas left…). Somehow, I still found myself craving more time with him. He must have felt the same since he asked me out the next morning. Well… the rest is history! Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! At the time, I was living in Southern California, and Navin moved back to Chicago, so we planned a trip to meet up in Las Vegas and drive to Bryce Canyon to celebrate my birthday. I knew a proposal was coming, just not when or how. I was convinced it would happen inside the park on one of the lat
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | er days of our trip, but he had other plans. On our very first day, while driving to our Airbnb, he suggested we switch up the schedule and do a hike I had originally planned for later. Little did I know, he had the ring in his pocket the entire drive! During a quiet moment with no one else around on that hike, he got down on one knee and proposed. It was so personal and peaceful—just the two of us. As we kept hiking, he started telling me all the reasons why he was proposing. Not the logistical stuff, but the mushy stuff: why I mattered so much to him, how long he’d known, and all the things that made me "the one." It was basically the love monologue from a romcom, but better because it was real. A little while later, we ran into another couple and asked them to take some photos for us, s
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ince we hadn’t gotten any during the proposal. He dropped to one knee again just for the picture! And as if twice wasn’t enough, the next morning we entered Bryce Canyon for sunrise and planned a special photo moment—so yes, he got down on one knee a third time! It was beautiful, hilarious, and perfectly us. To top it all off, we spent one last night in Vegas, where he took me to my very first Broadway show—Mrs. Doubtfire! When we got back to the hotel room, it was fully decorated with rose petals and balloons. I felt like I was living in a movie. Three proposals, one unforgettable weekend. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. We’re not your typical couple.
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | While most people assume the bride grows up dreaming about her wedding, in our case, it was actually Navin who had the vision. He always dreamed of a destination wedding, and I would never say no to traveling, so that’s exactly what we planned. Cancun quickly became the frontrunner because of the availability of experienced vendors who understood Indian weddings and all the beautiful chaos that comes with them. After doing some research, we came across Ateet from Indian Destination Wedding, and right away, we clicked. He knew his stuff and made everything feel manageable from the very beginning. He did all the heavy lifting in terms of research, presenting us with resorts that matched our vision and had the right availability. That’s how we landed on Generations and El Dorado Resorts in R
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | iviera Maya, where we were introduced to our resort coordinator, Lis. We had read that resorts don’t dive into serious wedding planning until closer to the event—but my type-A personality couldn’t handle the idea of sitting still until then. So we decided to bring in a planner, ideally someone based in Cancun who knew the lay of the land. That’s when we found Karla from Flawless Destination Weddings...and she was a total game changer. She had worked with Lis before (a happy coincidence!) and helped us with everything from vendor coordination to decor to the tiny details we hadn’t even considered. Basically, she made magic happen. Thanks to Karla, we found our amazing photographer, Ruben Chan, whose energy and passion were unmatched. He delivered beyond anything we could have imagined. I of
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ten find myself watching our short video just to reminisce. Our DJ was someone my husband knew from college, so we flew him in, which made the party feel even more personal and familiar. We also connected with Bernardo—the only priest in Mexico who performs Indian weddings and he was fantastic. He was incredibly detailed and made the ceremony meaningful while blending our traditions beautifully. For hair and makeup, we were lucky that one of Karla’s recommendations, Alex Cobanezi, was also on the resort’s approved vendor list. Alex and his team were not only talented but made the whole experience fun, relaxed, and flawless. For mehndi, we went with Loto Mehndi based on a friend’s recommendation and they seriously crushed it. The level of detail and symmetry was next level. Honestly, they d
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | id a better job than many artists we’ve seen back in India! When it came to decor, we took our time going through the resort’s options, outside vendors, and (of course) watching way too many YouTube videos. We picked our favorite colors and elements and brought it all together with help from Lis. Every event felt cohesive and personal. As for outfits, we made the trip to India because we knew we’d have better options and more variety. I was set on us coordinating for each event, and the final looks were so worth it. Everything turned out even better than we imagined. All in all, planning a wedding in another country definitely came with its challenges, but thanks to the right team, a whole lot of Google Docs, and some good old-fashioned intuition, we pulled off something that truly felt li
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ke our celebration. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? Watching our guest count go up became the most unexpected highlight of the entire planning journey. At some point, it stopped feeling like we were planning a wedding and more like we were hosting the most epic family reunion. Seeing friends and family commit to joining us in Cancun made all the planning feel worth it. We’d be at work texting each other every time someone new booked. It reminded us that this wasn’t just about the two of us; it was about celebrating with all the people we love in one place. The planning process also brought us closer to our friends and family. Whether it was coordinating our stays, helping us with ideas, or planning dances, we ended up reconnecting with so many friends and
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | family members in a way we didn't expect. It made the whole experience even more special. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? One thing our guests really loved was the clear communication, especially because the wedding was in Cancun. We worked with Indian Destination Wedding, and in addition to our own wedding website, they created another site that outlined everything guests needed to know (booking info, resort details, and transportation logistics). Knowing that things can change, we also created a WhatsApp group ahead of time and sent out the link before guests arrived. It allowed us to easily update everyone on venue changes, share reminders, or even let people know where we were hanging out around the resort. It kept everyone in the loop and really helped peop
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | le feel included. Another favorite was the attention to detail. We designed our own wedding logo and used it throughout—from invites and signage to handouts and even the dance floor. Every event had coordinated outfits, personalized stationery, and little touches that reflected us as a couple. Guests also loved the gifts we gave throughout the weekend. For the Haldi, we handed out reusable jute tote bags filled with essentials like an itinerary, welcome note, QR code for the WhatsApp group, and travel-friendly items like sunscreen, candies, Liquid IV, Tylenol, lip balm, and (a crowd favorite) Haldiram packets! For the Mehndi and Sangeet, we included bangles and tikkas. And at the wedding itself (knowing the heat and humidity could be a lot) we gave out rechargeable handheld fans and packet
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s of nuts to help keep everyone cool and energized. To keep the kids entertained, we brought activities and toys for some of the events. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? The one thing Navin insisted on having was a sword for his wedding outfit. Not a specific outfit or dance number—just a sword. After some challenges, he finally got one. Meanwhile, as we were browsing cake cutters, it hit us: why buy something we’ll use once and then forget about, when we’ve got this dramatic, over-the-top item just begging for a moment? Cue the lightbulb —we used the sword to cut our wedding cake! He was all in, of course. And yes, we even had our first bite eating off the sword. It was hilarious and one of those moments we'll always replay in our hea
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ds with a smile. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? The best advice I can provide is one that was provided to me: no one else is going to know what went "wrong" except you and your husband-to-be. Things can and will go off plan (because that’s just how life works), but don’t let it steal your joy. Just keep going, stay present, and soak up every moment. We definitely faced our challenges with unexpected changes and issues, but we knew we had to keep going to provide the best experience for our guests. We still had an amazing experience and love looking back at our photos and videos to relive all of the wonderful memories. Maharanis, feeling inspired?

What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? Working with Nirali Shah Events was truly the highlight of our entire planning process! Nirali and her team are one of a kind.

And of course… the first look with my husband! For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. For our welcome party, we wanted a desert tropical vibe, relaxed yet vibrant, with everyone dressed in tropical chic to kick off our beachside wedding weekend.

My family eventually tore off Harsh's shirt as tradition with "Turn the TV Off" by Kendrick playing in the background, specifically the "Mustard" part of the song. It was a hilarious touch by our DJ, DJ Jusi. Our Sangeet was bright, colorful, and full of energy, complete with disco balls, a decorated shot wall with a custom sign stating "Masti and Mojitos", a checker board, pink and white dance floor, and a beautifully decorated head table.
