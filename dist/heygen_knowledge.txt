Huntington Beach, CA Indian Wedding by White Rose Production Cinema December 19, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some weddings sweep you into their world the moment the film begins—and Shreena & Neil’s celebration was exactly that magical whirlwind we never wanted to step out of. When White Rose Production Cinema and Photo , known for their crisp cinematography, radiant photojournalism, and uncanny ability to capture every glamorous twirl, unveiled this masterpiece, we knew we were witnessing something extraordinary. They have a way of preserving emotion so authentically that you almost feel like a guest, seated in the
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | front row with goosebumps and happy tears ready. From the very first frame to the final dance-floor spark, every detail radiated intention, artistry, and pure joy. The couple kicked off their festivities at the chic Paséa Hotel & Spa , where their sangeet quickly turned into the kind of night you talk about for years—the kind filled with color, energy, and choreography that would make Bollywood proud. The ocean breeze mingled with music, laughter, and a certain kind of electricity that only happens when two families become one. Behind the seamless magic was the powerhouse planning alchemy of Ridhi Ratanjee, Opal Events , and the creative gurus at 2Create Designs , whose signature touch is unmistakable. Their combined expertise brought the couple’s vision to life with cinematic precision.
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | From lush, overflowing florals to perfectly curated décor elements, 2Create Designs ensured that every single corner felt like a modern royal affair. If elegance and personality had a baby, it would look exactly like this wedding. Our bride, glowing with confidence and charm, was a vision thanks to Dolled Up by Lulu . Every hairstyle, every makeup detail felt effortless and beautifully polished—a true MW moment where glam meets grace. And when the music hit, 3D Sounds and Aaron Martinez took over the room like seasoned party architects, blending beats that kept the energy sky-high until the final farewell. There's a special kind of dance floor chaos that only the best DJs can orchestrate—and trust us, this was the kind where no one wanted to sit down, not even for dessert. But the heart of
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | it all was Shreena & Neil—their chemistry, their playfulness, and the way they looked at each other like the entire world disappeared. It was the kind of love that reminds you why we adore weddings in the first place. This is a celebration that deserves to be replayed, shared, and bookmarked for inspiration. So maharanis, if you’re dreaming of a wedding filled with artistry, ocean views, and unforgettable moments, you’ll want to dive into every second of their cinematic story.

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Los Cabos, MX Indian Wedding by Meraki Weddings December 18, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Komal & Audwin’s wedding was a four-day cultural symphony, a vibrant fusion of Indian and Filipino traditions wrapped in modern elegance and sealed with ocean breeze. Captured brilliantly by Meraki Weddings , every moment look

The festivities opened with an intimate American ceremony themed “All Shades of Blue,” a serene coastal moment that beautifully reflected the blending of two families. Guests arrived at a candlelit Welcome Dinner that felt like a soft embrace—warm lighting, ocean air, and an effortless elegance that instantly made everyone feel at home. The night flowed into Komal’s Bridal Henna, where Lemons & Mehndi crafted a masterpiece of meaning. Hidden within the intricate designs were symbols of the couple’s life: their shared careers in healthcare, the Las Vegas skyline where love flourished, their adorable Cavapoo B

The next morning, the Haldi burst alive in joyful hues of yellow and blue. Turmeric, tradition, and laughter blended effortlessly while mimosas clinked in the background—because in Komal & Audwin’s world, sacred rituals and modern fun coexist in perfect harmony. The couple ended the ceremony dancing around the urli, glowing (literally) as family cheered them on. By evening, the energy soared as the Sangeet began under the creative brilliance of JC Castillo Weddings , the planning and design team who engineered each event with both precision and artistry. Families performed heartfelt routines, and in on

Warm, fresh churros circled the venue as guests twirled under the stars, and as the final beat dropped, Baja Fireworks lit up the sky in a spectacular display that turned the night into pure magic. The Hindu wedding ceremony took elegance to an entirely new level. Held above the ocean on a clear glass stage layered with real florals, Komal’s entrance looked like she was floating on petals. The House of Castillo created a mandap blooming in soft pink and tropical tones—romantic, lush, and bursting with coastal charm. Sacred rituals unfolded as waves kissed the shore and families watched with emotion, celebrating not just a m
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | arriage but a beautiful merging of cultures. After the couple sealed their vows, their exit became one of the most iconic moments of the entire weekend. Guests showered them with petals as Komal & Audwin raised their garlands in triumph, the sky erupting into a swirl of color. And because every great love story deserves a movie moment, they rolled away in a vintage white convertible—Komal’s lehenga fanned out in couture perfection, and Audwin looking like the leading man he was born to play. The grand finale unfolded inside the Hard Rock Los Cabos ballroom, transformed into a lavish glam-and-boujee wonderland by the talented rentals and décor teams, including Zuniga Los Cabos . Dramatic lighting by Inspire bathed the room in a luxe glow as guests entered the final celebration of the weeken

Dinner by Chef Hari Dev delivered a culinary experience that left guests raving, and Kumba Entertainment turned the dance floor into a full-blown celebration. A sentimental Filipino money dance honored Audwin’s heritage, blessings pinned onto the couple as they danced with gratitude and joy. But the night wasn’t done. Komal and Audwin surprised their guests by blasting CO₂ laser guns into the crowd, instantly turning the elegant ballroom into an electrifying party. Live sitar music by Ronobir Lahiri added a poetic touch earlier in the evening, and favors curated by Monica Kachru of Minka Bazaar treated every guest to a piece of the magic. The entire weekend flowed seamlessly thanks to the flawless planning by J C Castillo Weddings , the artistry of Glitterati Events with their custom in

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Carlsbad, CA Indian Wedding by Balerina Films December 16, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some weddings feel like events. Others feel like full-blown experiences you never stop replaying in your mind. And then there are celebrations like Ruhi & Akash's—where every moment, every color, every tradition, and every detail feels like a chapter of a love story intentionally crafted to be lived, felt, and remembered. For Ruhi, the wedding vision wasn’t confined to a day on the cale
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ndar. It was a journey—one that began in the most heartfelt place of all: her childhood home in Irvine, CA. For Haldi, Ruhi wore an orange sharara with a dupatta flowing from the back. For Sangeet, a coral red outfit was perfect, as it stood out amongst our blue and white European-inspired decor, and the outfit flared beautifully during all the dance turns. She had her mehndi applied on the same outdoor green bench she grew up playing on —a moment so tender that even the sun seemed to pause to watch. From there, the festivities swept everyone into the luxurious embrace of Omni La Costa Resort in Carlsbad . Thanks to the artistry of Eventspell , every detail radiated intention and elegance—each vignette curated to reflect Ruhi & Akash’s aesthetic and cultural fusion. JnJ Florals elevated th
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | e atmosphere with floral work that felt alive. Their arrangements danced in color, adding texture, warmth, and dimension across all three events. Combined with rentals from Team Impulse Events , the entire setting became an immersive canvas of art and emotion. And then came the performances—courtesy of Adaa Dance Academy —a series of beautifully choreographed numbers. When the wedding day arrived, the energy shifted into something equally powerful but distinctly serene. Exchanging handwritten vows became Ruhi’s most cherished moment—deeply grounding, beautifully vulnerable, and a reminder that the heart of a wedding is always the love shared between two people. Speaking of cinematic, this entire celebration could have been a film. And thanks to Balerina Films , it practically became one. W
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ith their signature unobtrusive style and immaculate storytelling, they captured every fleeting glance, every teardrop, every explosive color moment, and every glitter-soaked dance in a way that felt both editorial and deeply personal. From Seema Gujral’s sangeet glam to Rachit Khanna’s regal wedding couture to the glowing artistry of Makiaj and Drea V Makeup , every fashion and beauty detail enhanced the celebration’s visual language—effortless elegance with a dash of “oh wow.” The one-stop service place for bridal hair & makeup from Dimpsi Mehndi gave her a stunning look. She truly shone with her bridal look. Ruhi dazzled in her Sulakshana Monga royal blue reception gown, embodying elegance and sparkle from head to toe. And then a glitter cannon showered Ruhi & Akash in a sparkling casca
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | de. Dancing under a rainfall of shimmer, surrounded by the people they love, was a moment the bride says she’ll never forget. Honestly, who could? Throughout the night, 3D Sounds kept the dance floor alive, shifting seamlessly from high-energy baraat beats earlier in the festivities to electrifying reception mixes that had multiple generations sharing the dance floor. When hunger struck, guests enjoyed the flavors of Mantra and Manohar Delhi Palace , blending tradition with indulgence in a menu that felt like a culinary love letter. Ruhi & Akash’s wedding was more than stunning design. More than luxury details. More than choreography, couture, or cannons of color and glitter. It was a heartfelt tribute to heritage, home, family, and love—a celebration where every choice reflected who they
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | are. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? In 2021, we were both busy in medical residency while also trying to date. I was in coastal Ventura while Akash was living in Las Vegas. We matched on Hinge and met up at a Mexican restaurant in Costa Mesa for our first date. The conversation lasted hours, and we felt like we had known each other forever. We vowed during that date that we would see each other every 2 weeks and make long-distance work. Soon, the only thing getting me through residency was his FaceTimes at the end of the long day. I had never met someone so caring, funny, and genuine, and I knew that this was a once-in-a-lifetime type of love. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Akash knew he wanted to propose to me before we finished residency, whi
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ch was a whole operation, as Akash was still living in Las Vegas. Akash teamed up with one of my best friends to create a plan. My friend who recently got engaged told me she wanted to do a photoshoot with her closest friends in Palos Verdes. This was believable because she was also a professional photographer and seemed like something she would do. I, fully believing I was there for her photoshoot, arrived at this beautiful location with my 3 best friends greeting me. My friends then walked me to the proposal spot, a gazebo full of flowers and candles overlooking the ocean. Akash was waiting for me underneath, and I could not believe this was my proposal. My family and friends then surprised me with champagne and flowers, and we enjoyed the beautiful sunny day with stunning ocean views. I
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | t was such a beautiful moment having my 3 best friends walk me over to my future husband at our proposal spot – such a good blend of a romantic moment with my husband as well as a culmination of all of the feelings with my best friends being with me through all of the years. Afterwards, Akash added more to the surprise and had an after-party at my childhood home in Irvine with all of my closest family and friends, with a live pasta station and an open bar. I could not believe Akash pulled this all off! Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. When I envisioned our wedding, I dreamed of a joyous experience that felt like us in every detail. I wanted a mehndi and
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | haldi in my childhood home in Irvine, CA. I got my mehndi done on the same outdoor green bench that I grew up playing on, which was such a special moment. Since our proposal was overlooking the ocean, I wanted a different, greener, nature-filled vibe for our wedding. I immediately loved Omni La Costa in Carlsbad because it allowed us to have 3 different beautiful locations for all of our events. It was also nice as it felt like a mini destination, as most family and friends were from Orange County. I knew I wanted an outdoor sangeet where guests felt like they were dancing under the stars. For the wedding, I knew I wanted vibrant colored decor and a color cannon along with a raised aisle. It was so beautiful seeing the color cannon amongst the palm trees and the ponds in the background. F
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | or my mehndi, I wore a traditional green outfit, but I added flair with a voluminous braid with pink flowers and a pearl paranda. For my other outfit choices, I chose non-traditional choices. For Haldi, I wore an orange sharara with a dupatta flowing from the back of it. For sangeet, I wore a coral red outfit that was perfect for sangeet as it stood out amongst our blue and white European-inspired decor, and the outfit flared so beautifully during all of the dance turns. For my wedding, I chose pink, and for the reception, I chose royal blue. For my hair and makeup looks, I came in with specific pictures of hair and makeup, but I also let the hair and makeup artists give their own input as well, which I think, in turn, created such a variety of looks. I also had two different hair and make
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | up teams for my events, which I think ended up working out so beautifully, as every look felt really unique. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I knew I wanted a pink bridal lehenga, but I wanted it to still look very royal. The lehenga had intricate embroidery that featured flowers and bird,s which I felt was so unique. When I wore it for the first time, both of our parents and my sister in law could not stop looking at it and I knew it was the one. I combined light emerald green jewelry which gave a beautiful contrast. The dupatta was a slightly darker shade of pink and featured embroidery on it. My favorite element was the dainty kaleera, which had butterflies falling from it, which felt so elegant. What was the most enjoyable
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | part of the planning process, and why? I loved planning all of the dance performances at our wedding. We even did a dance at our Haldi with my cousin sister and my sister in law, which was so special. I loved doing a dance with my mom and then also performing my bridal solo dance, which was a surprise for my husband, Akash. I loved seeing his face in excitement and surprise. Akash even learned multiple dances with me for sangeet and reception, and he is not a dancer at all, but he did an amazing jo,b and it was so sweet of him to be so involved in dances for me. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? My guests loved the wedding ceremony and the vibrant colored decor, the exchange of personal vows, and the color cannon at the end. They cannot stop talking about the color
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | cannon and how it was the perfect finale for the wedding ceremony. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? On our wedding day, I entered with my brothers under a floral canopy down a set of stairs, which was so special. Our ceremony combined both our traditions of Marathi culture with Rajasthani elements. Exchanging handwritten vows was my favorite moment—it was deeply personal, grounding us in the midst of tradition. For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. The Haldi was so special to me because my mother DIY'd all of the decor in the courtyard of my childhood home and it turned out so, so beautiful! She ordered wooden planks, nailed them toget
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | her, and painted them white herself. She then adorned flowers to strings and hung them on the structures. She ordered beautiful florals and a platform stage to complete the look. Then her friends came over and decorated the house with flower pots and other beautiful decor. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? Looking back, I realize our wedding was less about perfect décor or timelines and more about the feelings we created. My advice to future brides is simple: design for the emotions you want people to carry home. Trends fade, but the magic of shared laughter, happy tears, and a packed dance floor—that will stay with you forever. Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) We loved doing a
