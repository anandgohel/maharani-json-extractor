Newport Beach, CA Indian Wedding by Yasir Habibi December 3, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Anita & Ardalan’s love story is a reminder that destiny always finds a way. Though they grew up on opposite sides of the country, fate brought them together in Los Angeles, where a simple message on a dating app sparked a connection that would change their lives. From their first conversation, it was clear they had something special—two strangers who quickly became best friends and, in time, soulmates. Their proposal story is as unforgettable as their bond. Ardalan had planned to propose in Paris, but Anita’
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s unexpected food poisoning nearly derailed the moment. Determined not to let anything stop him, Ardalan went ahead with his plan, proving that love conquers all—even in a Parisian hospital. That night, filled with laughter and resilience, perfectly captured the essence of their relationship: strong, joyful, and unshakable. With the help of planner Ridhi Ratanjee from Opal Events , the couple created a wedding that reflected both their personalities and cultures. Set against a breathtaking coastal backdrop, the celebration featured rich jewel tones and thoughtful details that made their guests feel right at home. Anita chose a stunning gold lehenga for her Indian ceremony, a modern take on tradition, and especially loved her vibrant Sangeet outfit. The couple enjoyed planning every detail

Guests were moved by their personalized vows and the way they celebrated both cultures through two heartfelt ceremonies. A highlight for Anita was the surprise bridal party dance, which she joined midway to Ardalan’s delight. Anita’s advice to future brides: enjoy every moment of the planning journey, because it truly happens once. On the big day, let go of perfection and be fully present—because what matters most is the love you’re celebrating. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? Although they were on opposite ends of the country their whole lives, destiny brought them together in Los Angeles. Their spark was undeniable from the start. A simple message on a dating app led to this beautiful day.

The couple’s celebrations spanned an unforgettable weekend — beginning with a lively karaoke party and poolside drinks on October 24, a vibrant sangeet on October 25, and culminating in their ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception on October 26, 2024. Kritika & Neil’s love story began as a friendship, blossoming into something undeniable. The proposal was intimate and meaningful, a perfect reflection of their bond. From the start, Kritika knew she wanted her wedding to feel like “them” — elegant, timeles
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s, yet uniquely personal. With her mother and sister guiding her, she chose a classic red lengha for the ceremony and a navy blue reception gown for a modern twist. Every detail, from décor to music, was crafted thoughtfully, resulting in a weekend that felt cohesive and celebratory. “The most enjoyable part of planning was making it our own,” Kritika shared. Guests couldn’t get enough of the joyful energy, from heartfelt ceremony moments to hours of dancing on the reception floor. Two moments stand out for Kritika: exchanging letters with Neil on the morning of the wedding before their first look, and the electric atmosphere of the reception dance floor — pure joy in motion. Her advice to future brides: “Stay organized and true to yourselves. When the celebrations begin, let go of the det

Did you have a favorite color in mind? I’ve always been drawn to simplicity and elegance when it comes to bridal wear. For the wedding, I knew I wanted the timeless look of classic red. For the reception, I wanted something elegant but different from the usual colors, so I went with navy blue. My mom and sister were my style guides throughout — they have such a great eye and helped me find pieces that felt just right for me and what I was going for. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? Making it our own. It was so fun to plan a celebration that truly felt like “us,” with little touches that

There were stressful moments, but the joy outweighed it — from cake and food tastings to exploring our venue in advance and surprising our family with the final reception décor. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? Two moments stand out: the morning of our wedding, when we exchanged letters and read them early morning before seeing each other for our first look and our first look was amazing — it made everything feel real, like we were about to start forever with our best friend. And of course, then the reception dance floor — it was pure joy, with everyone we love dancing for hours. A night we'll never forget! Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be?

The couple wanted a venue that was as unique as their story—something spacious enough for all events in one location, while still feeling intimate and full of character. Their planners introduced them to a colorful, open-air hacienda just outside the city, and it was love at first sight. The proposal, true to Neal’s creative spirit, unfolded over their shared ritual of chai and New York Times crossword puzzles. He spent months coding a custom puzzle shaped like a question mark, hiding the words “Marry Me” diagonally across the grid. On a rainy Saturday in Brooklyn, he handed Divya the puzzle, and by the time she solved it, Neal was down on one knee. Back at his apartment, friends and family waited to celebrate the moment. Their w

The ceremony was a riot of color—vibrant florals, natural wood textures, and a yellow hacienda backdrop. Neal led a lively baraat, beaming at the sight of loved ones dancing behind him, while Divya’s entrance was equally heartwarming, filled with waves and joyful greetings. They even exchanged personal vows, adding an intimate twist to their Hindu ceremony. The evening reception glowed in green and gold, elevated but relaxed. Specialty cocktails, an incredible DJ set, and non-stop dancing set the tone. The night ended with a hilarious twist—without a cake knife, Divya used a cocktail stirrer to cut the cake, and guests eventually dove in hands-first. One of their favorite photos? Their sisters were eatin

From Sangeet dance parties to handwritten vows, every detail was infused with intention, joy, and just the right amount of chaos. Divya’s advice to future destination brides: “Be great hosts, expect the unexpected, and don’t take anything too seriously.” Their wedding was proof that the best moments are the ones you never plan for. Why and how did you choose this venue? We wanted a location that was unique to the destination, that could accommodate the wedding, cocktail hour, and reception in one day, and still hold up to 200 guests. Our wedding planners found this location, and we absolutely loved the character of the place and its vibrant colors. Who proposed and how? We always do the New York Times crossword puzzle over a cup of chai. We also love tryin

Neal decided that one of our future date ideas would be creating a crossword for each other (he actually came up with this before deciding to propose this way). He spent months creating a grid shaped like a question mark and wrote code to design a crossword puzzle where the words “Marry Me” were hidden diagonally. It was a rainy Saturday—we were at a cafe in Brooklyn doing our crossword puzzles—and he proposed at the end. When we returned to Neal’s apartment, all of our friends and family were there waiting to celebrate! Give us some insight into the wedding planning process. We chose a destination wedding to give our closest friends and family a chance to go on an adventure together and create unforgettable memories. We picked Mexi
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | co City because we knew our guests would love the food, culture, museums, nature, and history. After deciding, we interviewed two wedding planners with experience planning Indian weddings in CDMX. Xanath’s team won us over immediately—their energy was contagious, and they understood the cultural nuances of working with Indian families. Describe the wedding day (Feelings, emotions...) It was truly the most fun day of our lives. We both felt overwhelmed with joy seeing all our friends and family enjoying themselves so much. Ceremony Ambiance The ceremony’s color palette was colorful and rustic, with natural wood elements and a mandap covered in multicolored flowers. The guests wore vibrant colors, and set against the yellow hacienda backdrop, the whole atmosphere felt festive and joyful. We
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | kept things relaxed and full of natural, casual moments that helped us feel deeply connected to everyone there. Neal’s favorite part was leading the Baraat—he looked back and saw all of his people behind him, which was incredibly meaningful. Divya’s favorite part was her entrance, getting to wave and greet everyone who had traveled so far to celebrate. We also said personal vows, which is not usually part of Hindu ceremonies, and it made it even more special. Reception Ambiance The reception had a green and gold theme, more glitzy but still in harmony with the natural setting of the venue. The cocktail service was a hit—guests loved the specialty drinks and wandering through the hacienda. The DJs were absolutely amazing; everyone danced as hard as they could all night.

Advice to Future Destination Brides Definitely hire a local wedding planner who loves what they do.

SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | like talking to a trusted friend,” Neha says. “It made the whole experience feel safe, intentional, and exciting.” By their third date—an idyllic hike in New England complete with chutney sandwiches—she knew he was someone special. And after their first international trip together, exploring Hungary and Portugal, she was sure: this was it. The proposal, true to their story, was thoughtful and surprising. On a rainy day in Boston, Darshak lured Neha out with a clever fake brunch “bet.” As they strolled through a park, he began reflecting on their favorite memories—despite the threat of frizz. Then she spotted the photographer, and the moment became unforgettable. “Right there, in the drizzle, he dropped to one knee,” she smiles. “It was perfect.” For their wedding, the couple chose Cancun—a
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | location that offered ocean views, rich colors, and strong support for South Asian celebrations. With the help of their planner, they handpicked vendors via Instagram, piecing together an unforgettable multi-day destination wedding. Their ceremony was held under a tropical mandap by the sea, with the ocean breeze and crashing waves creating a cinematic backdrop for their vows. Neha wore a bridal lengha with deep family roots—first worn by her mother over 45 years ago and passed down to her sister. “It’s a piece of our family history,” she says. “It felt right to honor that.” From Holi on the beach with all ages joyfully playing in color, to a pastel-themed reception that felt like “walking into heaven,” every detail reflected their personalities and cultures. The sangeet, designed with a
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | sunrise color palette, featured energetic dances lovingly choreographed by friends and family. And thanks to DJ USA and DJ Shaarad, each event had its own musical heartbeat. For Neha, the best part? “Realizing what a great team we make. Planning this together taught us so much about each other.” Their advice: aim high, expect surprises, and smile through it all—you’ll want those pictures. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? I met my groom, Darshak, through a matchmaker! How classic/traditional?! She met with us both individually, interviewed us (and many others) and decided to set us up over email. In the world of endless options and noisy apps, being able to talk to an actual person like a friend or relative that has your best interest at heart was a total

I knew Darshak was going to be a very special person in my life on our third date when he somehow (by listening carefully) manifested all the things I love into one date: taking me to explore beautiful scenery in New England on a hike and packing a cooler with homemade chutney sandwiches and all the drinks and snacks I love! I knew he was the one when we took our first trip together to Hungary and Portugal and had so much fun building our itinerary day by day and exploring the cities in many different ways (food tours, biking, public transportation, holiday festivals etc.). I could see we had a similar zest for life and truly enjoyed each other's compan

In early 2024, we knew we were a perfect match and ready to spend the rest of our lives together. After finding the perfect ring and getting the blessing from all of the parents, Darshak orchestrated the ultimate surprise proposal in downtown Boston. To get me to the proposal location, he “lost a bet” and had to take me out to my favorite Boston brunch spot – a clever cover! On a drizzly Saturday, as we walked toward brunch, Darshak slowed down and began reminiscing about all our favorite memories together. I was surprised and confused because he knows what the rain would do to my straightened hair. But then I spotted the photographer and suddenly I couldn’t stop smiling. Right there in

Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. We started with the location that we thought would be practical and beautiful and would photograph well (my husband loves photography). Between that and my desire to have a wedding by the ocean, we decided Cancun would be a perfect location for our wedding. Not only was it readily accessible for most of our guests, there was also a whole system in place to support desi weddings there. Our planner helped us pick the venue that met all of our criteria. From there, we picked the date and all the vendors as they were available. We foun

The destination wedding posed a lot of logistical challenges, but the end result was extremely beautiful and made for an enjoyable/memorable guest experience! After locking in the venue, we did our site visit to start thinking about themes, decors, and more. The venue was largely fine, though we learned there that compared to other resorts in Cancun, they seemed to have less experience with hosting Indian weddings, but they were able to work with us to achieve much of our vision. We also did H&MU trials which was really helpful so that we knew what to expect during our wedding we

It is the lengha my mom wore at her wedding in India 45+ years ago. My sister also wore the same lengha at her wedding about 10 years ago and it just feel like a piece of and the women in my family. It's light, comfortable, has flecks of real gold, was designed by my mom, and is a style that is truly not available anywhere today. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? I think the most enjoyable part of the planning process was working together on a rather big "project" as a team for the first time and learning that we work surprisingly well together! I loved learning about Darshak's tastes and opinions and how our pri

I feel like between wedding planning, working, being healthy, and working out, we found a new level of discipline and were able to be our best selves firing on all cylinders! What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? A lot of the planning and choices we made were around the guest experience. Afterall, we asked them to travel hundreds of miles and across international borders to celebrate our love! So, it was incredible to hear our guests describe our wedding as being on vacation together where they got an extended amount of time to reunite with old friends and make new ones. We planned it out to have just one high-energy event each day so th

There was something for everyone, from our older relatives and family friends riding in a limo for the first time in their lives to onsite dance practices for the big group dance to nightly events held by the resort to entertain all of the guests. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? One of the more memorable events and "scenes" if you will at our wedding was Holi on the beach. We asked everyone to bring a white outfit and brought holi colors. We were able to play holi on the beach with all ages, young kids to older relatives, and everyone had loads of fun getting messy and then jumping into the turquoise blue ocean. This was one of the easiest event

For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. For our Sangeet, we tried for a sunrise theme that focused on all the bright colors. I wanted the focal point to be my outfit with many different bright colors, but we had a similar motif on the stage with a circle lotus pattern that worked very well for the garba (which was danced in the circle). In general, a theme with bright colors works really well for any Indian event because it looks like everyone goes with the theme. For the reception, we tried to plan the family outfits and decor to be pastel themes with a starry night backdrop. Tr

The dances were SPECIAL, everyone getting taking time to learn them, getting over their fears to perform publicly, and the friends choreographing and wrangling the troops to get them ready for the stage. This is an Indian traditional that will never get old and something that feels like a gift, an act of love for the bride and groom that is beyond any material gift you will receive!

Lastly, in the moment, having cameras in your face and stopping to take pictures may feel stressful, but you will be grateful to yourself later, so try to smile at all times (especially on the mandap) and direct photographers to grab photos with all the people you want pics with! Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) Mendhi was really fun, I thought of a few secret designs to get that Darshak would love such as the Iron Man symbol (one of his favorite Marvel characters) and the New York skyline (his favorite city).

Additionally, we met the Jhankarlo during our site visit. We made an instant connection with him and knew that he would be the one to capture our wedding. We shared our ideas for the events, the types of shots we wanted (including drone footage), and some concepts for the reception and he was able to manifest all of our ideas and more.

As co-captains of the GatoRaas dance team, their bond deepened, but their journey toward marriage wasn’t without challenges. With Indian, Pakistani, and Panamanian roots intertwining, they navigated complex family dynamics over ten years, patiently earning blessings from both sides. Their decade-long journey culminated in a magical proposal in August 2023. Yash led Umbar on a serene hike to an intimate cave where sunlight poured in, just so illuminating the moment as he asked for her hand. Weeks later, surrounded by family, they celebrated their nikkah ceremony, marking the official beginning of their life together. After just eleven months of planning, Umbar and Yash brought their vision to life with a

The festivities began with “Infinite Blessings,” a baraat on a hilltop overlooking the city, where Guatemalan drummers set the rhythm and the couple exchanged pheras against a backdrop of ancient volcanoes. Day two, “Party in Pana,” whisked 120 guests to Lake Atitlán. A “love boat” cruise offered explorations of local villages, coffee and chocolate tastings, and a lakeside sunset dinner before returning to Antigua’s vibrant streets. The highlight was “Dancing in the Moonlight”—a sangeet held at the historic amphitheater La Ermita de Santa Cruz. Over 200 guests danced under the stars to electrifying beats, capped by a surprise fireworks show perfectly choreographed to John Summit’s “Shiver.” The grand finale, “Happy Endin

The reception at La Casa de la Ruina Santa Rosa dazzled guests with surprise dance performances, emotional speeches, and a wild “Hora Loca” celebration complete with playful props and bobblehead cameos of Bad Bunny and Lionel Messi. A golden sparkler exit sent the newlyweds into an after-party that lasted until dawn. Not quite ready to end their adventure, Umbar & Yash capped their celebration by conquering Volcán Acatenango, a symbolic summit to their decade-long climb to matrimony—proving that the most breathtaking views come after the hardest climbs. Love Beyond Boundaries: An Indian-Pakistani-Panamanian Fusion
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Wedding in Antigua, Guatemala A Decade in the Making When Umbar and Yash first met as 18-year-old freshmen at the University of Florida, neither could have predicted the beautiful journey that lay ahead. Brought together by their shared passion for dance as members of GatoRaas, their relationship truly blossomed in 2015 when they became co-captains of the team. Though they gravitated toward each other naturally, their path to matrimony wasn't without obstacles. Coming from different religious and cultural backgrounds—Indian, Pakistani, and Panamanian—meant navigating complex family dynamics that tested their resolve. While some family members embraced their relationship from the start, others needed time to come to terms with their union. After a decade of patience and perseverance, the co
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | uple finally received blessings from both families, allowing them to plan a celebration that honored their mutual love of dance, food, music, and joyful energy. The long-awaited proposal came in August 2023, when Yash led Umbar to an intimate cave at the end of a dreamy hike. As sunlight streamed perfectly into the cave, illuminating the moment as if orchestrated by fate itself, he asked for her hand in marriage. Just weeks later, both families gathered for an intimate nikkah ceremony on the couple's anniversary, marking the official beginning of their journey together. A Four-Day Celebration in Colonial Antigua After just eleven months of planning, Umbar and Yash's dream fusion wedding unfolded across four spectacular days in Antigua, Guatemala. Day one, aptly named "Infinite Blessings,"
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | took place on a mountainous hilltop overlooking the colonial city. The festivities began with Yash's lively baraat, enhanced by the rhythmic flair of local Guatemalan drummers. As the sun painted the sky in amber hues, the couple completed their pheras surrounded by close family and friends all dressed in ivory, creating a scene of ethereal beauty against the backdrop of ancient volcanoes. Day two brought "Party in Pana," where the couple and 120 guests embarked on a journey to Lake Atitlán. Boarding what they affectionately called the "love boat" from Panajachel, they explored local villages, learned about indigenous coffee and chocolate making, and concluded with a lakeside dinner at sunset before returning to Antigua for the excitement ahead. The third day, "Dancing in the Moonlight," w

The historic amphitheater-style monument, La Ermita de Santa Cruz, transformed into a vibrant sangeet venue where 200+ guests danced under the stars. The night reached its crescendo with a surprise fireworks display choreographed to John Summit's "Shiver," before everyone boarded traditional chicken buses back to their hotels. The grand finale, "Happy Ending," began with "The Vows"—a civil ceremony at the historic Convento Capuchinas, where the couple exchanged heartfelt promises before a friend who officiated. Following cocktail hour, all guests paraded through Antigua's cobblestone streets with drummers and saxophonists, drawing locals to join the celebration. The reception at La Casa

Emotional speeches from the parents of the bride and groom reminded everyone of the ten-year journey that brought them to this moment. The night continued with an "Hora Loca" filled with props and even appearances from Bad Bunny and Lionel Messi (in bobblehead form!). After a golden sparkler exit, the after-party continued until 4 a.m. at Antigua Brewing Co. Not quite ready to end their Guatemalan adventure, Umbar and Yash capped their celebration by conquering Volcán Acatenango, a fitting summit to their decade-long climb to matrimony—proving that the most beautiful views come after the hardest climbs.
