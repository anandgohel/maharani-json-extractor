Merida, MX Indian Wedding by The Wedding Filmer December 5, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some weddings make you smile. Some weddings make you cry. And then there’s Aayush & Suman’s wedding—a celebration so cinematic, so soul-stirring, and so beautifully human that you will find yourself smiling, crying, and pausing every few seconds just to whisper, “Wow… that actually happened.” When The Wedding Filmer takes the lead on cinematography, magic isn’t a possibility—it’s a guarantee. And this celebration at the lush Hacienda San Pedro was nothing short of breathtaking. From the start, the visuals feel like a
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | love poem in motion. Two grooms, two hearts, two families merging into one story framed by towering palms, warm island light, and the rustic elegance of the Hacienda’s old-world architecture. The Wedding Filmer , a powerhouse featured team known for crafting films that feel like intimate documentaries rather than staged productions, captured every moment with the tenderness and grandeur it deserved. Their signature style—raw, emotional, poetic—turned Aayush & Suman’s journey into a work of art. They are undoubtedly masters of their craft, having redefined what wedding movies can be. But they weren’t alone. Sahed Photography , Ashish Sawhny , Raj Sampad , and Addy Khanna joined forces behind the lens, turning this wedding into what can only be described as the Avengers-level collaboration o
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | f South Asian cinematography. Every angle, every tear, every hand squeeze, every laugh—it all found its place in a tapestry of beautifully crafted frames. Photographer Judson Rappaport added his own layer of storytelling with rich editorial stills that captured the grooms in their quiet moments: adjusting their tuxes, exchanging glances, and smiling like two people who know they’ve just won at life. Hacienda San Pedro provided the perfect setting for every chapter of this celebration—from sangeet to ceremony to a reception that glowed under strings of lights and the warm Caribbean night. The wedding planning was a blast thanks to Emmanuel Vega Events , who really understood everything they needed and handled the planning and design with enviable ease, transforming the historic estate into
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | a celebration where modern aesthetics met soulful tradition. Minimal Estudio complemented the natural surroundings with floral arrangements that were artistic without ever feeling overdone. Think greenery that felt organic and effortless, soft blooms tucked into stone corners, and details that whispered elegance rather than shouting it. The mandap was decorated with kaleere, a tradition that Aayush grew up with. The grooms looked every bit the modern style icons in ensembles by Bobo Calcutta , Siddartha Tytler , and Parama —design houses that know how to create fashion with equal parts edge, culture, and sophistication. Their sleek tuxedos from Philocaly Menswear completed the transformation, blending bold personal style with timeless tailoring. Makeup by Veronica Galvan ensured both groom
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s glowed (we’re not saying dewy perfection, but… yes, dewy perfection), and Mehndi by Veronica added a touch of artistic tradition that felt personal and deeply meaningful. The sounds of the night were curated by DJ Robert Firth , who kept the energy both elevated and intimate—perfectly matching the emotional tone of the films. At the reception, guests dined on exquisite dishes by Margo Amalia , a culinary artist whose flavors transported everyone straight into a sensory love story. Every plate was a reflection of the joy being celebrated. And through it all, The Wedding Filmer captured a story that wasn’t just about two people getting married—it was about love choosing courage—family choosing acceptance. Community choosing celebration. The wedding film reflects all of it: the unfiltered e
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | motion, the laughter between friends, the tenderness in vows, the electric reception energy, and the quiet moments where the world seemed to pause just for Aayush & Suman. If you’re ready to fall in love all over again, watch their film and immerse yourself in the beauty of what happens when the right couple meets the perfect creative team. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? We met in medical school in India. I (Aayush) made the first move —I found Suman walking around campus and said I liked his artwork, though he didn't really pay much attention (or maybe he secretly did). But I did not give up, and eight months later, we were dating. In Suman’s version, it took Aayush eight months to get the hint that Suman was already head over heels in love. We like to
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | think of our love as a first date that never ends, despite the challenges of long distances spanning years and sometimes continents. Somehow, despite the distance that often separated us during our years of medical training, we grew closer together. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! After making Aayush wait for over a decade, Suman planned a surprise proposal in Central Park, New York. He brought Aayush along with the pretense of meeting their closest friends for their son's photoshoot, except that the lens was waiting for the two of them. There, in front of Bethesda fountain, Suman went down on one knee (in white trousers!), and Aayush went speechless for the only time in his life. For the proposal, Suman designed the engagement ring with a marquis diamond to represents ‘A’ and a t
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ension setting to represent ‘S’, thus combining their names in eternity. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. As we started planning the wedding, we knew that we wanted to incorporate details that were unique to our lives. Aayush had always wanted to have a traditional wedding where all family and friends gather together in a big family home to celebrate over lovely songs, ancient rituals and endless cups of chai. Suman, ever the romantic, loved the idea of a historic home with large gardens and majestic trees. Haciendas in Merida fit the bill perfectly and we left it to our wonderful wedding planner Emm to find the perfect spot! We wanted our guests to fee
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | l like they were coming home. In a time when we are all scattered across the globe, we wanted everyone to be able to come together and feel a part of a family. And, over the course of the weekend, we did all become one family. We trusted our planner Emm to find vendors who would understand our vision and he found the perfect team. Everyone, the design team, catering, DJ and venue staff, saw the beauty in our story and were genuinely happy for us. We knew they are the experts in their crafts and we let them create their magic, which was the best decision! Memories are important to us, so we brought along our amazing photographer Judson from New York (who captured our proposal) and our dream videographers, The Wedding Filmer, from India. How did you select your wedding outfit? Did you have a
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | favorite color in mind? We sourced our wedding outfits from India to reflect our love for the rich textile heritage that we grew up with. We both do not follow gender norms in our style and we chose androgynous looks for our wedding day as it best represented us. Aayush wore a couture Anarkali style outfit in dusky pink with old gold trim by Siddhartha Tytler. Suman wore a traditional lehenga and angrakha designed by Fauzia Khan which featured Chikankari and Mukaish. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? The wedding planning was a blast for us. Thanks to our planner Emmanuel Vega (Emm) who really understood us, we got to enjoy every little bit of the process. All of our vendors paid personal attention to making our dreams come true. One of the most enjoyable p
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | arts was our initial trip to Merida, Mexico with Emm and his team - not only did Emm plan every part of our trip, he also helped us navigate the myriad decisions and made sure we had an amazing time when the work was done - though we could never keep up on the mezcals! Our caterers, even though they had never cooked Indian food, did such a wonderful job learning our culture and even brought out the spices for us to approve at the tasting. And of course, shopping for outfits in India is an adventure we would never forget, It spanned three cities and countless trials and we loved every bit of it. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? The venues! The lovingly tended gardens all around us, the beautiful table settings that the staff put together each day, the Oxacan candle
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s, honey liqueur Xtabentun, and rattan fans that Emmanuel (our planner) and the design team sourced from across Mexico, each little detailed made the time that much more magical. Throughout the few days, our guests (and us) loved that so many of the elements were handcrafted and represented us in both planned and unplanned ways. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? For Suman, it was watching Aayush come down the aisle slowly, and then midway realizing that the slow walk is not for him so he literally sprints down the steps toward me (Suman) with the most beautiful smile on his face – that is my most cherished memory. For me (Aayush), it was the first look in the light of a candle (Shubho-drishti, in Bengali tradition) where I saw Suman in
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | his intricately embroidered Chikankari lehenga with traditional Bengali bridal eye makeup, covering his face with his hands (which had betel leaves design henna on his hands) – truly like Bengal Royalty! For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. One of the special touches to our wedding was the gender fluidity in the customs. The wedding altar (mandap) was decorated with kaleere - jewelry that traditionally adorns the wrists of a Punjabi bride and symbolizes good wishes from her family- a tradition that Aayush grew up with. Unconventionally for a groom, Aayush also wore a pair of Kaleere on the wedding day, decorated with individual charms that his closest friends, family, and Suman had picked
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | out for him, including a blue door to represent Suman’s dorm room, their safe place. Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) One of the vendors most special to our hearts is the videographer team The Wedding Filmer.While they are undoubtably masters of their craft, having redefined what wedding movies can be, what was extra special for us was how every person on the team formed a personal connection with us. Though we only knew them for a few days, they have now become friends we cherish. Ashish -our director, Raj, Addy, and Sahed saw the infinite magic in the small moments and captured it so perfectly.

Sonata & Shirish first met on an online dating site, but from the moment they exchanged messages, it felt as though the universe had gently aligned their stars. Their connection only grew stronger through playful dates, shared adventures, and the kind of laughter that stays in your bones. Long before either said it out loud, they knew . This wasn’t just love—it was alignment. From that moment, their wedding vision began to bloom. They dreamt of a celebration that felt celestial—something ethereal, glamorous, and deeply personal.

Wedding Design & Decor transformed their dream into a living constellation—galaxy-inspired invitations, luminous welcome signage, ethereal seating charts, and a ceremony and reception space that looked as though it was kissed by stardust. And then came the moment every bride dreams of—finding the dress. After visiting boutiques and sifting through endless silhouettes, Sonata was captivated by Liya , the elegant mermaid gown from Pronovias. Timeless, regal, and subtly sparkling like the night sky itself, her gown featured full lace sleeves, intricate patterns that cascaded over the bodice, and a graceful plunging V-back paired with a sweeping veil. Under the soft ceremony lights, her dress shimmered delicately—an echo of the wedding’s celestial theme. For the reception, she
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | transformed into a vision of bold, vibrant romance in a fuchsia Nazranaa lehenga, embroidered with exquisite craftsmanship. The color danced beautifully against the vivid autumn foliage surrounding their outdoor ceremony. Shirish complemented her in a custom Suit Supply tuxedo and a regal Nazranaa sherwani in rich gold—handsome, refined, and absolutely wedding-day ready. Guests adored every moment—from the marble pillars draped in white florals at the outdoor ceremony, to the soft glow of candles and gold latticework enveloping the stage inside the grand ballroom at The Mansion on Main Street . Two towering video walls showcased their stunning engagement session, while the talented WSS Photography captured the awe and emotion of the day with elegance and artistry. Their images are beyond

As Coldplay’s A Sky Full of Stars began, dry ice rolled across the floor like clouds, lights sparkled like constellations, and sparklers ignited around them. They moved as if suspended in the night sky—two souls floating among the stars. It was breathtaking, emotional, and unforgettable. The celebration continued with a feast by Moghul Catering , featuring rich Hyderabadi biryani, tender Chicken Tikka Masala, Paneer Makhani, and decadent desserts like Rasmalai and Khubani Ka Meeta. The flavors delighted every guest, each dish crafted with immense care and authenticity. When it was time for the cake, Sunflour Bakeshop delivered a masterpiece: a dark-blu

As the M4U Events lit up the night, guests danced beneath the starlight floor, celebrating not only a wedding but a universe built between two people destined for one another. Sonata & Shirish soaked in every moment, holding onto the magic until the very last second. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"?

Shirish knew that Sonata was the one for him and someone he wanted to spend the rest of his life with.

Sonata’s wedding gown had a sparkle effect with glitter to complement the Starlight theme of her wedding. From the first look to the walk down the aisle, Liya's wedding gown highlighted Sonata’s beauty and captured the guests’ amazement.

Though they grew up on opposite sides of the country, fate brought them together in Los Angeles, where a simple message on a dating app sparked a connection that would change their lives.

Set in the heart of Mexico City, their wedding was a vibrant fusion of tradition, color, and community, set against the rust
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ic charm of a historic hacienda. The couple wanted a venue that was as unique as their story—something spacious enough for all events in one location, while still feeling intimate and full of character. Their planners introduced them to a colorful, open-air hacienda just outside the city, and it was love at first sight. The proposal, true to Neal’s creative spirit, unfolded over their shared ritual of chai and New York Times crossword puzzles. He spent months coding a custom puzzle shaped like a question mark, hiding the words “Marry Me” diagonally across the grid. On a rainy Saturday in Brooklyn, he handed Divya the puzzle, and by the time she solved it, Neal was down on one knee. Back at his apartment, friends and family waited to celebrate the moment. Their wedding in Mexico City was a
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | joyful four-day adventure steeped in love and spontaneity. The ceremony was a riot of color—vibrant florals, natural wood textures, and a yellow hacienda backdrop. Neal led a lively baraat, beaming at the sight of loved ones dancing behind him, while Divya’s entrance was equally heartwarming, filled with waves and joyful greetings. They even exchanged personal vows, adding an intimate twist to their Hindu ceremony. The evening reception glowed in green and gold, elevated but relaxed. Specialty cocktails, an incredible DJ set, and non-stop dancing set the tone. The night ended with a hilarious twist—without a cake knife, Divya used a cocktail stirrer to cut the cake, and guests eventually dove in hands-first. One of their favorite photos? Their sisters were eating cake straight from the pla
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | tter. From Sangeet dance parties to handwritten vows, every detail was infused with intention, joy, and just the right amount of chaos. Divya’s advice to future destination brides: “Be great hosts, expect the unexpected, and don’t take anything too seriously.” Their wedding was proof that the best moments are the ones you never plan for. Why and how did you choose this venue? We wanted a location that was unique to the destination, that could accommodate the wedding, cocktail hour, and reception in one day, and still hold up to 200 guests. Our wedding planners found this location, and we absolutely loved the character of the place and its vibrant colors. Who proposed and how? We always do the New York Times crossword puzzle over a cup of chai. We also love trying new challenges, activities
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | , and making things together. Neal decided that one of our future date ideas would be creating a crossword for each other (he actually came up with this before deciding to propose this way). He spent months creating a grid shaped like a question mark and wrote code to design a crossword puzzle where the words “Marry Me” were hidden diagonally. It was a rainy Saturday—we were at a cafe in Brooklyn doing our crossword puzzles—and he proposed at the end. When we returned to Neal’s apartment, all of our friends and family were there waiting to celebrate! Give us some insight into the wedding planning process. We chose a destination wedding to give our closest friends and family a chance to go on an adventure together and create unforgettable memories. We picked Mexico City because we knew our
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | guests would love the food, culture, museums, nature, and history. After deciding, we interviewed two wedding planners with experience planning Indian weddings in CDMX. Xanath’s team won us over immediately—their energy was contagious, and they understood the cultural nuances of working with Indian families. Describe the wedding day (Feelings, emotions...) It was truly the most fun day of our lives. We both felt overwhelmed with joy seeing all our friends and family enjoying themselves so much. Ceremony Ambiance The ceremony’s color palette was colorful and rustic, with natural wood elements and a mandap covered in multicolored flowers. The guests wore vibrant colors, and set against the yellow hacienda backdrop, the whole atmosphere felt festive and joyful. We kept things relaxed and full
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | of natural, casual moments that helped us feel deeply connected to everyone there. Neal’s favorite part was leading the Baraat—he looked back and saw all of his people behind him, which was incredibly meaningful. Divya’s favorite part was her entrance, getting to wave and greet everyone who had traveled so far to celebrate. We also said personal vows, which is not usually part of Hindu ceremonies, and it made it even more special. Reception Ambiance The reception had a green and gold theme, more glitzy but still in harmony with the natural setting of the venue. The cocktail service was a hit—guests loved the specialty drinks and wandering through the hacienda. The DJs were absolutely amazing; everyone danced as hard as they could all night. Wedding Attire We had our wedding outfits custom
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | -made in India. I wore a traditional South Indian white sari with gold embroidery and a red border, as per tradition. Neal wore a red velvet sherwani to match. Favorite Moments or Highlights All of our guests dancing to “Not Like Us” during the Sangeet was such a fun memory! Advice to Future Destination Brides Definitely hire a local wedding planner who loves what they do. Prioritize being good hosts—your guests have traveled far, and showing appreciation through great food, music, and comfort goes a long way. Also, don’t take anything too seriously! Expect the unexpected, and just go with the flow. Additional Details We couldn’t find a knife to cut our cake, so I used a cocktail stirrer instead. By the end of the night, guests were just diving into the cake with their hands! One of our fa
