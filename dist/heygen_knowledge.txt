SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | vember 14, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some love stories feel written in the stars—Nidhi & Sasikanth’s felt written across galaxies. Their journey began with a swipe, a spark, and a cosmic coincidence: the day they matched on a dating app, Sasikanth was working in the maternity ward of the very hospital where Nidhi was born . She was at UC Berkeley, hundreds of miles away, yet there he was, in the place her life began. If that’s not a sign from the universe, then honestly… what is? Six years of long distance only deepened their bond. Through time zones, airports, late-night FaceTimes, and more emotional airport goodbyes than any couple deserves, their love stayed steady. When they finally stood together overlooking the sunlit hills of Los Angeles, ready to exchange vows, it felt like d
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | estiny finally exhaling. And oh, did they celebrate that destiny beautifully. Pacific Palms Resort transformed into a breathtaking paradise where tradition met modern elegance. Subham Events by Kavita orchestrated the entire weekend with flawless precision—think Pinterest board perfection, but actually real and even better. Weddings by Wardah and Pure Chic Events brought the décor magic, layering soft pastels, thoughtful textures, and floral artistry that seemed to whisper romance in every corner. The mehndi, the sangeet, the ceremony—each event felt like a chapter in a perfectly illustrated love story. Nidhi looked every bit the modern Telugu princess. While many brides opt for metallic zardozi, she went in her own direction—pastel threadwork, a light green saree, a dramatic peach veil, a

In true Telugu tradition, jewelry played a starring role throughout the celebrations. Each event featured its own curated ensemble: antique gold temple jewelry for the Pellikuthuru, emeralds for the wedding, tanzanites for the reception (complete with navy velvet draping to match!), and rubies for the sangeet’s sunset theme. The emeralds popped beautifully against her custom Mishru ensemble and the elegant pieces from Divaa Jain Kastaan . Suhenna Creations adorned Nidhi with intricate mehndi that complemented every look beautifully. Makeup by Shazz worked her signature magic, ensuring Nidhi glowed effortlessly from sunrise to the sparkler exit. And let’s t
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | alk about those moments: White Rose Production Cinema and Photo captured them with breathtaking intimacy. Every tear, laugh, twirl, and “OMG she looks incredible” expression was frozen in time with an editorial finesse that we adore from our Platinum Guide–worthy cinematographers. They capture the true essence of the day: the connection, the family, and all the small, loving moments in between. More than a record of events, Amber Rain Photography images are a portrait of a feeling, pulsing with the life of two souls intertwined and a thousand fragments of love. Speaking of twirls… the Sangeet was a showstopper. Nidhi isn’t just any dancer—she’s a professional performer with over 300,000 followers, and yes, she delivered . With choreography that could rival an awards-show opener and the ene

Many of LA’s top South Asian creators were in attendance, adding sparkle to the guest list while Riamu Entertainment Inc . kept the dance floor alive until the very last beat. From cuisine to content creation, the vendor team delivered beyond perfection. Vishnu Catering and Mantra Caterers (with Chef Sumit Sharma leading the magic!) treated guests to a feast bursting with flavor. Onekahani captured behind-the-scenes moments like digital poetry. The groom, effortlessly stylish, wore custom designs by legends Manish Malhotra , Divaa Jain Kastaan , and Jayanti Reddy , completing a weekend of fashion-forward brilliance. Guests couldn’t stop raving about the way the couple beautifully intertwined Telugu traditions—Jeerakara Bellam, Thalli Katadam, Talambralu—

Every detail radiated joy, color, and culture, perfectly blending Miami glam with timeless Indian traditions. Their festivities kicked off at the Royal Palm South Beach , where the sangeet set the tone for a week bursting with laughter, music, and dance. Imagine glittering lights bouncing off the palm leaves, the rhythm of dhol beats blending with ocean waves, and guests grooving under the stars—it was pure magic. The wedding day unfolded at Loews Miami Beach , which is well-suited for hosting luxurious South Asian weddings. This iconic oceanfront venue became a paradise of elegance—think soaring white canopies, floral mandaps, and panorami

The expert team at Karma Goddess Event Planning flawlessly orchestrated each moment with their signature blend of sophistication and creativity. Every transition—from the baraat to the ceremony to the reception— was executed with seamless precision and heartfelt attention to detail. The décor, designed by Petal Productions , turned the venue into a floral wonderland. Soft pastels mingled with lush greens, creating a dreamy palette that beautifully complemented Christina’s bridal look, perfected by Glam by Mevi . At first glance, Akshay couldn’t take his eyes off his Maharani—her smile said it all: this was the day they had been waiting for. As the sun dipped into the horizon, the couple’s reception took center stage. Guests entered a transformed b

The culinary experience, courtesy of 5th Element , was a feast of flavors and textures that delighted every palate—because no South Asian wedding is complete without that extra helping of spice and sweetness. Behind the lens, Otto Haring Photography captured it all—every laugh, tear, and twirl—with a cinematic eye that brought the story of Christina & Akshay’s love to life. From the tender mehndi moments created by Sumaiya Henna to the coconut sips by Coconut Reserve (yes, tropical hydration never looked this chic), every vendor played a role in turning their dream into reality.

Start dreaming, start planning, and let the professionals bring your vision to life. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? We met on Hinge, the dating app designed to be deleted once you find your forever match. I knew he was “the one” when he made me feel so comfortable and safe. With him, I realized I could be completely myself—and instead of holding back, he loved me even more for it. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. We knew we needed a venue that could accommodate 250+ guests while still being kid-friendly. Once we narrowed down our options to
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | the Loews South Beach, we fell in love with the location, the spaciousness, and the amenities that would ensure our guests felt comfortable and cared for. For hair and makeup, we relied mostly on word of mouth and ultimately chose someone with experience in Indian weddings, which was so important to us. Her Instagram handle is @glambymevi. When it came to our outfits, we drew inspiration from Miami itself—light, airy, and colorful to reflect the vibrant, tropical setting. For our décor, Petal Productions—recommended by our wedding planner—helped us bring our vision to life. We curated a bright and colorful theme for the daytime wedding to complement Miami’s blue skies and palm trees, and then transitioned into a more monochrome yet luxurious aesthetic for the evening reception. How did you
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? Finding my bridal lengha was easier than I anticipated. At first, I imagined myself in a traditional white gown, but after trying on the stunning array of colors that lenghas have to offer, I fell in love with a beautiful pink one that perfectly complemented my skin tone. For my wedding dress, I knew I would be wearing a saree. My mother-in-law, who was in India, was kind enough to have my blouse custom-made and also found a beautifully embellished saree to match. We FaceTimed a few times to make sure I loved the colors I had chosen, but I also fully trusted her to select the most stunning pieces—and she truly did. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? Our wedding was a three-day celebr

How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? I met Roneet on Hinge, and I knew he was "the one" when he proceeded to feed me tacos on our FIRST date. Just kidding... kinda. It was not only through his compassion, care, and selflessness through
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | out our relationship, but also how we brought out each other's inner child through laughter and tears, and how he nurtured every part of it. The best moments were and continue to be the best times but through the hardest times we broke down, communicated, understood each other, and grew not only individually but together. It didn't take long for me to realize this is my person, and we couldn't wait to enjoy and cherish this life together. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! We had the most amazing day together at home doing the things we normally do on a Saturday. Cooking breakfast together, enjoying some relaxing time at the pool, and then sitting on our egg chairs on the balcony, laughing and talking, feeling so connected, when Ronnie got on both knees (because he had a torn ACL) and
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | asked me to be his wife! Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. Wedding planning was a journey! I wouldn't change it for the world. Choosing Los Willows as our venue was one of the best decisions we made. It is truly the most magical place, an escape and a place of its own. The moment we saw this venue, we knew this was the one. The energy in this venue is ethereal and everything we wanted. @DolledUpByLuLu, LuLu dolled me up for my big day, and I have to say, as I'm sure many know, she did not disappoint!

They were so well organized and delivered the dream mandap I imagined, in addition to everything else. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I always imagined wearing something different from the norm, but as the day drew closer, I realized this is the one time I get to fully wear red, especially knowing how auspicious it is. I found a few places in SoCal that had amazing options with a hefty price tag, but I really wanted something unique and affordable, so ultimately I found a place in NorCal, Megha's Closet. Not going to lie, communication was lacking through the whole process, but the outfit qua
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | lity and delivery was amazing. I walked into her boutique and immediately knew this outfit was the one. Once I received it, it fit like a glove, no additional alterations needed. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? The most enjoyable process during wedding planning was with Ronnie, envisioning our special day together. To truly create something that was our own, of course, with the help of our vendors, parents, and family. But to be in a space where Ronnie was invested and involved in creating our dream day was the most beautiful thing to create together. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? Our guests by far loved the entertainment at cocktail hour, our flute player. Anis Chandani. He delivered beyond what we requested and even expected
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | . We were running behind schedule, and he kept the energy and party going even prior to the start of our reception. Anis had guests singing and dancing, and there were such special moments to watch for Ronnie and me as we enjoyed all of our photos and wedding footage from the cocktail hour. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? The most special moment for me during our wedding was when I finally saw Ronnie during our first look. I had been very stressed and anxious amongst all the emotions and anticipation, and when I saw Ronnie, I felt at ease, and I knew everything was going to be okay. Other honorable mentions would include when I saw Ronnie walking down the aisle with my mother (which wasn't part of our timeline) and when I saw my fathe
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | r the moment before we walked down the aisle together. Sharing my first dance with my father was one that I will hold closest to my heart. For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. The decor by TBD San Diego was beyond what we had expected. We created a mood board and met in person, where they mocked a centerpiece and asked all the questions to understand what we were looking for. As I look back, I can honestly say I wouldn't have changed it in any way. The special details, such as invites, drink signs, and fans, were all designed and created by my best friend and Maid of Honor, Shilpa Hampole. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? Wedding planning is a lot, sometimes a lot of opini
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ons. Stay engaged with the things that matter to you most and understand that every detail really isn't going to be the biggest deal in the end. Put the work in beforehand to ease your mind as much as you can day of. But in the end, no matter what happens, enjoy every moment. It really does go by so fast. So don't sweat the small stuff, the small details. The things that may not have gone as planned, know one will know, and only you and your husband will remember. It'll be something you laugh about later. Cherish the magical moment you have with him through all of it, cause it really is something else. Once in a lifetime. Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) Ronnie would like to add... It was lit.
