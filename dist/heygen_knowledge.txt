COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Chino Hills, CA Indian Wedding by Yin Studio September 16, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments When two worlds come together under California sunshine, you get a wedding like no other—Disha & Zack’s breathtaking celebration was the perfect blend of culture, elegance, and pure joy.

Henna by Sanjana brought the tradition of mehndi to every swirl , while Glamorized by Penny Kohli worked her magic with flawless hair, makeup, and sari draping that made Disha glow brighter than the California sun. Dressed in a stunning creation from Kynah , our Maharani looked every bit the queen she was meant to be. And when the veil was perfectly tied? That was the kind of “mic drop” bridal moment every girl dreams of. Picture majestic temple architecture, floral artistry by both the Chino Hills BAPS Mandir team and Events by FS , and vows exchanged under a mandap that looked carved straight from a dream.

When the sun dipped and reception time arrived, Vellano Estate transformed into the ultimate stage for glamour. Guests indulged in decadent treats by Some Crust Bakery , proving that love may feed the soul, but cake feeds the celebration. The celebration was captured with perfection by Yin Studio , whose lens caught everything from stolen glances to the kind of laughter that can only come when surrounded by your favorite people. With his cinematic eye, Robles Video Productions preserved every movement, every tear, every dance.

The standout moment wasn’t just in the grand architecture or the designer fashions—it was in the smiles, the energy, and the love that filled every corner of the day. Ready for more jaw-dropping wedding inspiration? Follow us on Instagram and dive into stories that will leave you pinning, planning, and dreaming about your own big day. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? Zack and I met in college during our internship. We were good friends first, and talking to each other was so easy. We spent a lot of time together with our friends and eventually went on a date and have been together ever since. I knew he was the one when we were grocery shopping together after moving across the country. We had just moved in, and I remember standing in the spice aisle and
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | realizing I was having so much fun just getting groceries together. I knew if I could have fun with him at Ralph’s, I could enjoy the rest of my life with him. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Zack proposed to me on top of Mauna Kea on Hawaii’s Big Island. We went stargazing in the pitch black, and in the middle of my yapping and trying to identify stars in our Jeep (with the top down), he pulled the ring out. I was truly surprised, cried, and said yes. His number one goal was to make sure I had no idea it was coming, which is not an easy thing to do because I’m very nosy! He definitely succeeded. I was caught so off guard. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other importa
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | nt details. Planning our wedding was a challenge because we wanted to make sure both our cultures and upbringings were represented. We had a two-day wedding, the Hindu ceremony at the BAPS temple in Chino Hills, and our American ceremony at Vellano Estate. It was important to us to make sure both venues were unique and allowed our guests to fully experience the ceremonies. We chose June 27 and 28th as our dates; my grandparents were married on June 28th for over 60 years. My Ajji passed away in 2022, and it was a small way of keeping her close. I know it was her dream to come to my wedding. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I’m from Bangalore, so I was always going to wear a silk saree for my Hindu Ceremony. My original plan was
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | to wear my mom's saree and for my sister to wear our Ajji’s saree, but my mom's saree was heavily damaged. My parents went to India, and my dad had actually picked a beautiful pink saree for my mom in Mysore (where my mom grew up). When we realized I couldn’t wear my mom’s saree, she suggested the pink one. I loved that I had no input and my parents picked it for me, the color and thread work was so beautiful. I liked that the pink was unique to weddings, too. For my American ceremony, I chose the white Sasha Lehenga from Kynah. While I debated wearing a traditional American wedding dress, I still wanted both my cultures to be represented. I loved how unique the Lehenga was and knew it was the perfect blend of Indian and American. Both my outfits spoke to who I am and how I was raised. Wha
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | t was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? Spending time together was my favorite part! Whether it was cake tasting or putting invites together, I loved the moments when it was just the two of us. We actually designed and created our invites from scratch. We went to the venues and took pictures, and had an artist from Etsy create them into watercolor paintings. We then used a template to create the invite, and my husband selected the paper, printed it out, and got a paper cutter to make them. I also got an illustrator to make stickers of our dogs, which I used on the belly bands. I told my husband my vision for the invites, and he truly made them a reality. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? On Friday, we had our first friend we made in LA offic
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | iate, and only one person each in our bridal party, Zack’s best friend from college, and my sister. It was really special to us to have personal touches because without our friends, we wouldn’t have stayed on the West Coast. Guests loved that it was just a group of friends at the altar who truly knew us and could speak about our relationship. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? After our Hindu Ceremony, we were exhausted and took a minute in the bridal suite to just sit down. When we came out for lunch, everyone was almost done, and eventually the entire seating area was empty. We just sat there for a long time, the two of us, taking in the day. It was a quiet moment, and I remember looking around the temple and thinking we did it! Anothe
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | r moment is also after the Hindu Ceremony, our East Coast and West Coast friends went out to eat and drink. It was surreal seeing my entire friend group in one place. I felt so special. So many people took off work on a random Thursday and flew across the country for us! Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? One step at a time! It’s all very overwhelming, but once you remember everyone wants to celebrate you and your fiancé, everything becomes so much easier. I also didn’t eat very much because of nerves, so make sure you have simple snacks if you’re like me and hate attention! Darlings, want to see your wedding featured?

How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? I met my groom through my childhood friend who introduced the both of us. I knew
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | he was the one right away, only after a few days of talking and getting to know each other. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! It was actually Raj’s birthday weekend! He made me take a PTO to celebrate his “birthday” in Tampa, Florida. We got there on Thursday and he planned a picnic proposal for Friday. He told me that we were going to his college friend’s engagement party and told me the dress code was solid navy blue or white only (all lies smh). The day of the proposal we walked around the streets of Tampa and enjoyed each others company, went on a boozy boat cruise throughout Tampa bay (really setting the celebration mood) and then we got ready for the “engagement party.” At this point it was over 95 degrees in Tampa and the uber driver dropped us off conveniently to the wrong lo
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | cation, to which Raj said we’ll just walk. I was sweating, he was sweating, I was annoyed because he was too hot, he was surprisingly calm. And then I saw a “marry me” sign with a picnic table set up and pointed it out to Raj, laughing, saying, “look! Someone’s getting proposed to.” It wasn’t random for us, for some reason almost every date we’ve been on, there was always a proposal going on. Raj laughed and told me to look closer at the sign, and when I did, it said “Will you marry me, Vishva?” And I had absolutely no idea that this was all for us, he planned it all so perfectly. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. We envisioned a destination wedding that
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | felt intimate, divine, and deeply meaningful — a celebration surrounded by nature’s beauty. From the beginning, we dreamed of an outdoor setting with mountains, water, and lush greenery as the backdrop. After attending a conference at Cheyenne Mountain Resort in Colorado Springs, we instantly knew it was the perfect place. The resort offered a stunning blend of panoramic mountain views, serene landscapes, and spacious venues that could accommodate our 300 guests comfortably. Cheyenne Mountain Resort checked every box — from its luxurious amenities to its breathtaking scenery, it set the stage for a truly unforgettable wedding. The vision we had spent months curating came to life through the incredible work of the Invogue Events décor team, who transformed every space into something magica

David Gass, our photographer, captured every perfect moment — from emotional candids to stunning portraits — and knew exactly where to shoot for the most picturesque backgrounds. The music, curated and brought to life by DJ Sahil Mehta, elevated the energy of each celebration. And the food? Absolutely phenomenal — thanks to Pakwan Caterers and Bawarchi Caterers, who delivered unforgettable flavors across all events. We wanted our wedding to be a one-of-a-kind experience, in a location few had explored, and we’re so grateful we made that vision a reality. Every event was filled with joy, love, and awe — all set against bright, sunny skies and the breathtaking views
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | of Colorado’s natural beauty. We truly immersed ourselves in every moment, and it was everything we hoped for and more. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I originally didn’t want to choose a red lengha. I thought that it would be cheesy since everyone wears red and I originally wanted a pastel colored lengha. But my mom had actually convinced me that red would look really good even if it was “classic.” And after I kept telling her I didn’t want to, she made me try one on while we were in India. And that’s when I realized that red was definitely going to be the color. Not an orange red, not a bridge red, but a deep red that was vibrant enough not to look fake or not enough to wash me out. And when I found this lengha, I fell in lo
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ve with all the intricate embroidery along its skirt and especially the blouse. With the dupatta that would be overlying my head, I didn’t want it to be plain see-through, so my mom, cousin, and I decided on doing the checkered look with the gold embroidery. It was scary to choose something from India because the final dress wasn’t available to see until it was completely done, but it was so worth it at the end because it’s probably one of the most beautiful dresses I’ve ever worn.

The wedding venue itself was breathtaking with views of the lake and Cheyenne Mountain in the back at every single wedding event. The weather was perfect, we were blessed and it rained before our events started and after. Our guests travelled around Colorado before and after the wedding as well. Bringing our families together in such a versatile destination to celebrate our wedding was probably what was enjoyed the most. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? There are too many special moments to choose from—the entire wedding felt like a dream. I would say that one special moment that constantly replays in my head is our
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | private wedding vows and first look. The Cheyenne Mountain team, our photographers and our wedding planners chose a location in front of the beautiful mountain for us to meet for our first look. Then, we were able to share special, private vows with each other and just have a moment to ourselves to take in the blessings that we received during the entire wedding week before we got officially married. The fact that our photo/videographers were able to record this special moment for us was amazing as well since now we have these memories for life. Another one of the most special moments of our wedding was witnessing the heartfelt speeches and the incredible dance performances by our loved ones. Each performance was filled with so much love, joy, and intention — it made the entire celebratio
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | n feel like a surreal dream. What touched us the most was knowing that so many of our family and friends traveled from all across the country — and even from abroad — just to be there for us. Their presence made everything feel even more meaningful, and we’ll forever cherish the memories we created together. For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. The dances we left to our families and friends to plan. For us it was more special to be surprised by performances by our loved ones and to know it wasn’t forced and that each one of them took the time to rehearse, coordinate, and perform their hearts out for us. The décor for each event was nothing short of pristine — every detail thoughtfully cura
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ted to reflect the vision we had dreamed of. Lata, our incredible decorator, brought each theme to life with creativity, precision, and heart. Every event was bursting with vibrant color, carefully chosen elements, and intricate touches that took countless hours to plan and execute. Her dedication and artistry transformed every space into something truly unforgettable. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? My biggest piece of advice is to really be present and soak it all in. You’re going to blink and it will be over! Don’t get caught up in the last-minute details — once you’re a week or two out, let go of the checklist and just enjoy the moment. What’s done is done, and it’s going to be perfect no matter what. If you can, absolutely get a wedding coordinator — even if it’s jus
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | t a day-of coordinator. We had planners throughout the process, and during the week of the wedding we were so grateful for them. They kept us on time, helped ease our stress, and handled any little misfires behind the scenes so that we could just focus on each other. Finally, take intentional time with your husband before and after the wedding events to pause, breathe, and really feel everything that’s happening. It’s such a special, once-in-a-lifetime moment. At the end of the day, it’s your wedding — nothing matters more than that. Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) The bridal mehndi was AMAZING. We hired Suchi and her team (Instagram: Scorpius_art_henna) and they were phenomenal. They made sur
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | e the day before our mehndi night that our main family was taken care of and even stayed late to finish up. And the mehndi was beautiful. “A huge shoutout to Barkha Vyas and Archita Upadhyaya and their incredible teams for hair and makeup. Flying a makeup artist out was one of the easiest decisions we made because our families and I trusted them completely to make us look radiant while still feeling like ourselves. They truly listened to what we wanted, enhanced our natural beauty, and made sure we felt confident every step of the way. I can’t recommend doing a makeup trial enough and choosing artists who make you feel comfortable in your own skin — it makes all the difference. The cake was delicious, we went with a lemon cake with raspberry custard in between and this was provided by Suga
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | rplum Cake Shoppe. The coordination with their team was so smoothe and they designed our cake just how we wanted it within our budget. Photo and Video team by David Gass was incredible. I can’t say more nice things about their team—I mean, you can see how great they are just from the photos they took. Not only are they incredibly talented, but they were timely, efficient, and very respectful of our boundaries as well. Working with them was such a pleasure. Our decor was absolutely stunning as well. Bouquet, garlands were all provided by InVogue events — Lata. She and her team were very professional and they were flexible with any time we wanted to meet, all late night phone sessions, and they provided their honest opinions on what would look good and bad. Because of our stunning location,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | we felt that we didn’t need to do over the top decor because the view itself was decor enough but Lata’s team did a great job of balancing the decoration with the natural backdrop of the venue itself. We were very pleased with how everything turned out. Words can’t even describe how much we loved our DJ and wedding planning team. Riddhi, Sahil and the entire Sugar Events team were truly the best decision we made for our wedding. From the final months of planning to the chaos of wedding week, they handled every detail flawlessly and kept us calm, on time, and able to actually enjoy the moment. Nami, Puja, and Navvya went above and beyond — supporting us like family and making sure we didn’t have to worry about a thing. We’re beyond grateful for them and couldn’t recommend Sugar Events more
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | — they’re the ultimate hype squad! And of course, the food deserves its own spotlight. We worked with Pakwan and Bawarchi for catering, and let me tell you — it was some of the best food we’ve ever had in the United States. Our guests could not stop raving about it! The flavors were unforgettable, the presentation was flawless, and the communication between the caterers was seamless. Our only regret is not being able to enjoy more of it ourselves (because, you know, bride and groom life!). Together, the venue and catering teams gave us an experience beyond anything we could have dreamed of. Last but certainly not least— the Cheyenne Mountain team was an absolute dream come true. They are the reason our entire vision came to life — from providing such a breathtaking venue to making the plan

Haley and the rest of the team were beyond accommodating, going above and beyond to meet our requests and making us feel truly cared for every step of the way. They ensured that every detail was executed beautifully, while also creating an atmosphere where our families and guests could relax and celebrate. The combination of the stunning backdrop and such a professional, kindhearted team made our wedding everything we could have hoped for — and more.
