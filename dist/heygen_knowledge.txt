Fords, NJ Indian Wedding by Lightyear Studio October 10, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments When it comes to South Asian weddings, the magic is in the details—and Aaska & Kishan’s celebration had plenty of details that made us swoon, laugh, and grab the nearest box of tissues (happy tears only, of course). From the moment guests arrived at the iconic Royal Albert’s Palace , it was clear this wasn’t just a wedding; it was a full-on experience. With its grand ballrooms and timeless charm, the venue set the stage for a love story that the Bollywood gods themselves could have written. Both the ceremony and reception took place here,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | and trust us when we say the palace did not disappoint—it practically whispered, “Yes, this is the royal treatment you deserve.” Now, let’s talk florals and décor, because wow . Mandap Milap transformed the space into a dreamscape of color and tradition, creating a mandap that looked straight out of a modern-day fairytale. Paired with lighting and live music by the talented team at Kurani Studios , a proud Platinum Guide member, the atmosphere was electric. They didn’t just “do lighting”—they created moods, set the tone, and ensured that every sparkle, every beat, every corner of the room said, “This is a once-in-a-lifetime party.” They even brought their magic touch to the photo booth, because what’s a celebration without a few goofy props and keepsake snapshots? Our bride, Aaska, looked
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | radiant with hair and makeup by the ever-talented Herneet Kaur of Glow by Herneet . This wasn’t just a glow—it was the kind of glow that comes from knowing you’re marrying your soulmate and from an expertly blended highlighter. Herneet’s artistry also extended to draping and styling, ensuring Aaska’s look was flawless from every angle (yes, even the candid shots). The celebration was sweet in more ways than one, thanks to Cakes by Ashni , who crafted treats that were as delicious as they were beautiful. Guests probably debated whether to admire the artistry or dive right into the cake—spoiler: they did both. And speaking of artistry, the lens masters at Lightyear Studio captured it all—cinematography and photography so vivid , you can almost hear the music and taste the ladoos just from l
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ooking at the images. Their highlight video is a cinematic journey in itself, proof that some moments are just too perfect not to relive again and again. For the mehndi, Shama Mehandi Artist brought her intricate magic to life, adorning Aaska’s hands with patterns as detailed as the couple’s love story. Each swirl and motif was as much a symbol as it was a piece of art. This wedding had it all—tradition, joy, laughter, and a “wow factor” that left every guest buzzing long after the last song played. It’s the kind of celebration that reminds us why South Asian weddings aren’t just events; they’re epics . If you’re dreaming up your own happily-ever-after, take a cue from Aaska & Kishan’s big day.

SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | lling” gorgeous. Frederick gave us moody skies and spring light, and Hunter and Sarah Photography turned it into a masterclass: our bride in a pastel, sequin-sprinkled lehenga framed by historic windows; mehndi-lined hands stacked for a girlfriends’ moment; a baraat in cool mint safas sweeping through town like the happiest parade; and a mandap strung with jasmine and marigold garlands that swayed as vows were spoken. Dulany’s Overlook set the tone with a charm-soaked sangeet , then Citizen’s Ballroom delivered the big-city-meets-historic-drama reveal—airy balconies, glowing sconces, and a dance floor that practically begged for a twirl. Blake Events ran the weekend like a symphony conductor—precise timelines, smooth room flips, and gracious hospitality that made 200 guests feel like VIPs.
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Wild Indigo leaned into modern garden romance with roses, ranunculus, and textural greens that read beautifully in daylight and under chandeliers. Beauty was perfectly “camera-literate”: hair by Amanda Fiorita and glam by Behind the Veil (with a shoutout to Makeup: Jenn) gave Laura that lit-from-within glow that held from first look to the last hug. The paper suite by Cork & Chambers was a love note in ink—clean typography, custom monogram, and delicate motifs styled to perfection. Rentals from Something Vintage layered in character, and Carriage of the Capital kept everything moving with polished ease. The food and music? A study in joyful excess. Bollywood Bistro and Simply Fresh tag-teamed the menu—flavor-packed stations, auntie-approved spice levels, and second-helpings energy. Luxe E

Alison Bakes Cakes provided the sweetest exclamation point, while Audrey Lynn Films captured motion and meaning in equal measure—those tear-and-laugh beats you’ll replay for years. Fashion moments landed too: Nazranna Bridal jewels and ensembles, bridesmaids in Azazie pastels, a classic gown from Jennifer’s Bridal , and the groom toggling between Manyavar élan and Michael Thomas tailoring.

From a sunshine-kissed first look to a rose-petal exit that had everyone grinning like proud aunties, their celebration was a masterclass in style, sentiment, and seamless pacing. Paperboys told the story with editorial precision. It’s the kind of gallery that feels like a film: tender, dynamic, and delightfully rewatchable.

Tradition and Trends layered texture and bloom—soft pastels for day, deep reds for evening—so each event felt distinct yet perfectly cohesive. And when the lights lowered, Platinum Roadshow flipped the switch from elegant to electric, filling the dance floor faster than you can say “one more garba.” Beauty was camera-literate and lasting. Maryam Asim Beauty gave Nimmi that coveted luminous finish—glossed lids, sculpted cheekbones, and a classic lip that read beautifully from golden hour to ballroom glow. Alfaaz Henna’s intricate mehndi added storybook detail, and the sangeet at Rasoi kicked off with the kind of
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | choreography that convinces even the shy cousins to “just try one step.” By reception time, a cloud-effect first dance floated across the room while guests happily debated whether the showstopper was the dancing…or the dessert. Benares Catering made a compelling argument for “both.” We’re still enjoying the moments. It’s Gujarati tradition with a modern wink, executed by a dream team that understands how celebrations should feel and how they ought to look.
