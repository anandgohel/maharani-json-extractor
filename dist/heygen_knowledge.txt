Fords, NJ Gujarati Wedding by Romil Shah Films January 8, 2026 Posted by: Shawna Comments There’s something incredibly special about a wedding that doesn’t try to be anything other than exactly who the couple is —and Rajvi & Kirtan Gujarati's wedding was a joyful, heartfelt reflection of that truth. With over 300 loved ones in attendance, their celebration was big in scale, rich in tradition, and overflowing with emotion, laughter, and the kind of energy that only comes from a room full of people who truly know and love the couple. The day began with a calm buzz of excitement—one of those mornings where time feel
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s like it’s moving too fast and too slow all at once. Surrounded by family and friends, Rajvi & Kirtan prepared separately, soaking in the anticipation of a day they had dreamed about for so long. But the moment they saw each other, everything else faded away. The nerves, the noise, the schedule—gone. It was just them, standing at the start of forever. Hosted across multiple events at the elegant Royal Albert's Palace , the wedding weekend unfolded seamlessly from sangeet to ceremony to reception. Bringing their vision to life was The Bridal Bestie , whose thoughtful planning and design ensured every detail felt intentional and deeply personal. The ceremony honored Gujarati traditions while weaving in meaningful touches that reflected Rajvi & Kirtan’s journey—from heartfelt rituals to quie
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | t, emotional moments shared in front of their loved ones. Visually, the celebration was elevated by Mandap Milap , whose décor struck a beautiful balance between grandeur and warmth. The mandap, stage, and reception spaces were styled to feel regal yet inviting—setting the perfect backdrop for vows, laughter, and countless photo-worthy moments. Rajvi was a radiant bride, glowing with confidence and joy. Her bridal beauty was flawlessly executed by Natia MUA , who created a look that was timeless, polished, and perfectly suited for a full day of celebration. Her fashion story was equally stunning, featuring bridal ensembles from Asopalav and Kalki Fashion , paired with elegant jewelry from Kalamandir Jewelers . Together, every detail reflected tradition, craftsmanship, and Rajvi’s personal
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | style. Kirtan complemented her look effortlessly in classic groom fashion from Riyaasat , bringing a refined, regal presence to the celebration. And then came the party—because what’s a Gujarati wedding without a dance floor that never quits? MVP DJs , led by DJ KRU and MC Dubs, kept the energy sky-high all night long. From emotional first dances to full-blown dance floor takeovers, the celebration was nonstop, joyful chaos in the very best way. Sweet treats by D Town Cakes ensured guests had the perfect sugar-fueled finale to an already unforgettable evening. Every moment—big and small—was captured beautifully by Romil Shah Films , whose storytelling style preserved not just the visuals , but the emotion behind them. Their photography and cinematography documented the smiles that wouldn’t

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Somerset, NJ Indian Wedding by Saroj Studios January 6, 2026 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some weddings are polished, some are emotional, and then there are those rare celebrations that feel warm, intentional, and joyfully alive from the very first moment. Blair & Aakash Fusion wedding in Somerset was exactly that—a beautifully balanced celebration where tradition met personality, elegance met energy, and every detail felt thoughtfully chosen rather than simply checked off a list. Hosted at the stunning The Imperia by Dhaba , the celebration unfolded with effortless sophistication. Known for its grandeur and ability to host South Asian weddings with precision and heart,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | it offered the perfect backdrop for this wedding. One of the most unforgettable moments of the celebration was Aakash’s grand baraat entrance, elevated beautifully by Equishare Baraat Horses, Rickshaws and Carriage s. Their majestic horses and impeccably presented procession added a sense of regal tradition and excitement, instantly setting the tone for the festivities ahead. It was a striking blend of cultural significance and celebratory flair—an entrance that felt both meaningful and memorable, and one that guests will be talking about long after the last song played. Behind the scenes, the seamless flow of the day was orchestrated by KM Events Management , whose planning and design expertise ensured every moment unfolded exactly as it should. From ceremony timing to guest experience, t
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | heir work allowed Blair & Aakash to focus on what mattered most—being present, soaking in the love, and enjoying every second of their wedding day. Visually, the wedding was a feast for the eyes thanks to Partyland Sajawat , whose décor struck the perfect balance between elegance and celebration. Rich colors, lush florals, and thoughtfully layered details transformed the ceremony and reception spaces into an inviting, festive atmosphere that felt elevated without ever feeling overdone. Blair looked radiant as she stepped into her role as bride, glowing with confidence and joy. Her beauty look, created by Makeup By Anu Sarin , was timeless and refined—designed to enhance her natural features while holding up flawlessly from the first ceremony moment to the last dance of the night. Paired wi
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | th bridal fashion by Nirali Beauty Care , every detail of her look felt cohesive, elegant, and undeniably bridal. Intricate mehndi by Nirali Shah added a beautiful layer of tradition and artistry, completing her wedding-day ensemble with meaningful detail. And then came the party—because once the music starts at an Indian wedding, there’s truly no turning back. MVP DJs kept the energy high and the dance floor packed, delivering the perfect mix of crowd favorites, Bollywood hits, and celebratory beats that had guests dancing well into the night. Adding an extra layer of romance and ambiance was Sweet Harmony Live Music , whose live performances elevated key moments throughout the celebration. No celebration is complete without something sweet, and Palermo Bakery delivered treats that were a
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s beautiful as they were delicious—giving guests the perfect ending to an already unforgettable evening. Smashed Photobooth ensured laughter, candid memories, and keepsake moments were captured all night long. Every meaningful glance, joyful laugh, and emotional embrace was beautifully preserved by Saroj Studios , whose storytelling approach goes far beyond traditional documentation. This love story unfolded naturally through every frame—creating memories they’ll relive for a lifetime. Blair & Aakash’s Somerset wedding was a reminder that the most memorable celebrations aren’t just about how beautiful everything looks—but about how deeply it feels. It was joyful without being overwhelming, elegant without being stiff, and rooted in tradition while still feeling entirely personal. Are you d

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Yorba Linda, CA Indian Wedding by KimFilms & Hollycal Production January 5, 2026 Posted by: Shawna Comments Hello, Maharanis! Check out Angela & Sunjay's stunning wedding on today's Platinum Guide Blog ! How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? Sunjay and I met on Shaadi.com in 2020, on the eve of the pandemic. I was on shaadi.com because my mom kept telling me to go on there. I told her it would be pointless but signed up for a month to prove my point. I came across Sunjay’s profile a few times but didn’t interact with him until my last few days on the website. I ended up sending him a message and didn’t think he would respond. He did and
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | the rest is history. Jk, he responded and then March came about and we went into shutdown. We ended up talking on the phone, watching Netflix virtually, and became really good friends over the course of the next 10 months. We went on our first date late in the year and have been together since then. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Sunjay had an elaborate set up for the proposal. We started talking about getting engaged and looking at rings in 2023, so I knew a proposal would be coming at some point but didn’t know when. Sunjay proposed in summer of 2023. Sunjay told me we would be going to a mixer type event for work. Prior to this event he took a keen interest in telling me to buy a nice dress and to get my nails done. So I thought ok this might be the proposal? We both met up in
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | downtown and he made a big ordeal about forgetting to get his work name tag and went back to the car to get it. Once I saw the name tag I thought “oh ok we are going to a work event after all.” Once we got to the top floor and out of the elevator, an Ed Sheeran song started to play, til this day I can’t remember which one. We turned the corner and there was a whole set up with “Marry Me” letters, rose petals scattered all over the floor, and a photographer. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. I’d say I took the lead on wedding planning since I am an Emergency Planner by profession, it came easy to me. Sunjay was involved in the planning process, he actual
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ly picked out our venue Richard Nixon Library. We booked Dhamaka Productions as our DJ and it’s funny because while we were deciding on a DJ, my sister actually met our DJ at another event and that’s what sold us. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? Red is my favorite color but I always wanted to be a green bride. I decided this even before I met Sunjay, I think I was subconsciously drawn to the color because it’s my mom’s favorite color and turned out to also be Sunjays favorite color. I followed CrossoverBollywoodSe on instagram for some time, so when the time came to design outfits it was a no brainer that I wanted to work with them for both bride and groom outfits. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and w
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | hy? Honestly, it was very challenging given that Sunjay’s mother suddenly and unexpectedly passed as we were planning for the wedding. We had to move our date out and it was an extremely difficult time. Also over the span of 5 years my dad passed away, both of Sunjay’s parents passed away, 2 of my dogs passed away, as did Sunjay’s dog. So it was very heavy and full of grief but we made it through together. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? The venue, the food, and the overall vibe. The feedback we got from our guests seems that they were not underwhelmed nor overwhelmed, it seemed just right and enjoyable. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? During cocktail hour our planner pulled us aside to show us the reception
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ballroom where we had an opportunity to take it in and were able to take a moment for ourselves. For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. Our vendors worked really hard to pull something together that was representative of Sunjay and I. The wedding decor was understated, classic, and smooth just like us. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? Plan early, step number 1 is pick the venue, and dates and everything will follow and fall into place. Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) We had a memorial table set aside to honor my dad, Sunjay’s parents, and our dogs.

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Riviera Maya, MX Indian Wedding by Saptapadi Weddings January 2, 2026 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some love stories begin with a carefully planned first date. Others—like Akilah & Ankur’s —are written entirely by fate, with zero regard for itineraries, backup plans, or what could have been. Kismet isn’t just a word in their story; it’s the headline. They met exactly where destiny intended: Cancun. Akilah was celebrating her bir
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | thday with friends, Ankur was there for a friend’s birthday of his own, and despite staying at different resorts (and originally planning completely different trips), their paths crossed at a concert. One moment, one conversation, one unmistakable spark—and suddenly, everything else made sense. Akilah describes Ankur as her manifestation in human form, the embodiment of everything she had hoped for in a partner. When you know, you really do know. Fast forward to March 2024, when Akilah thought she was heading home for an award ceremony honoring her brother. Instead, she walked into a breathtaking botanical garden filled with the soft sound of a violin—and Ankur, on one knee. As if that wasn’t enough, the celebration continued with a surprise gathering of their closest family and friends. S
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ubtlety was clearly never part of Ankur’s plan, and honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way. So when it came time to plan their wedding, it felt only fitting that their celebration would return to the place where it all began—Mexico. Hosted in the sun-soaked beauty of the Riviera Maya, their fusion destination wedding was a masterclass in intentional planning, cultural harmony, and joy multiplied by ocean views. With the expert guidance of Indian Destination Wedding, Inc. , a Platinum Guide member known for making the impossible feel effortless, Akilah and Ankur found the perfect venue and ensured their guests were seamlessly taken care of from arrival to farewell. That journey led them to Generations Riviera Maya , where the turquoise sea, lush surroundings, and warm hospitality creat

From coordinating pre-wedding visits for makeup trials and menu tastings to curating a vendor dream team across Mexico, their planning and design ensured that every detail reflected Akilah and Ankur’s personalities and cultures in perfect balance. The décor told a story all its own. K'ndy Flowers transformed each space with lush florals, elegant textures, and thoughtful details that felt both elevated and welcoming—never overdone, always intentional. The result? A visual experience that felt immersive without ever overshadowing the emotion of the moments unfolding. Akilah’s bridal beauty was radiant and refined, thanks to Beauty Experts , who perfected a look that celebr

From soft glam to statement moments, every look felt confident, timeless, and completely her. Energy levels stayed sky-high thanks to Empire Entertainment , who brought the perfect mix of beats, baraat excitement, and dance-floor magic. Add in the vibrant flair of La Hora Loca, and you have the kind of party guests talk about long after their return flights land. One of the most meaningful layers of the celebration was how seamlessly cultures blended—not just in décor and fashion, but in spirit. From the ceremonies led by Pandit Bernardo to the artistry of Loto Mehndi , every tradition was honored with intention and heart. Guests didn’t just attend a wedding—they experienced a true fusion of families, backgrounds, and life cha

And because no Maharani Weddings feature is complete without unforgettable visuals, Federico Salmeron Photography captured every emotional glance, joyful embrace, and sun-drenched celebration with an editorial eye that feels both timeless and alive. On the cinematic side, Saptapadi Studios , a Platinum Guide favorite, preserved the movement, music, and magic of the weekend in a way that will let Akilah and Ankur relive it all for years to come. Akilah’s words of wisdom for future brides say it best: pause, breathe, and soak it all in. The little things fade. The feeling stays. And if this Riviera Maya fusion celebration is any indication, the feeling was nothing short of extraordinary. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? Kis

Though we were staying at different resorts, our paths crossed at a concert, which was a meeting that was truly meant to be.

I knew he was the one when I realized that he was my manifestation and everything I dreamed and hoped for in a partner. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story!

Our wedding journey began with Indian destination weddings, which helped us find the perfect venue and took care of our guests' accommodations. Through them, we met our amazing wedding planners.

With their connections across Mexico, we were introduced to some of the most talented vendors who helped create the perfect fusion of our cultures and personalities in every detail. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? Our guests were at the heart of what made our wedding feel so magical. Seeing people from so many different chapters of our lives come together added a deeper layer of meaning and warmth to the celebration. From the moment that they arrived, they expressed that they were in absolute awe, and while the ocean and resort set a tone, they weren't the only breathtaking factors. They especially appreciated the attention to detail that was woven into every part of each day. It was the fresh flowers, elegant decor,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | captivating performances, the receptions prior to our ceremonies, and the variety in the selection of food. Our guests could tell that every element was intentionally done and carefully planned. Beyond the beautiful aesthetics, everyone raved about how much fun they had celebrating a true fusion of cultures and traditions. Many guests told us that our wedding set a new standard, one they'll be reminiscing about for years to come. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? Take every opportunity to pause, breathe, and truly soak in the joy and love surrounding you from everyone who came to celebrate such an important milestone with you.
