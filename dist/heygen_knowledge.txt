COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Carlsbad, CA Indian Wedding by Balerina Films December 16, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some weddings feel
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | like events. Others feel like full-blown experiences you never stop replaying in your mind. And then there are celebrations like Ruhi & Akash's—where every moment, every color, every tradition, and every detail feels like a chapter of a love story intentionally crafted to be lived, felt, and remembered. For Ruhi, the wedding vision wasn’t confined to a day on the calendar. It was a journey—one that began in the most heartfelt place of all: her childhood home in Irvine, CA. For Haldi, Ruhi wore an orange sharara with a dupatta flowing from the back. For Sangeet, a coral red outfit was perfect, as it stood out amongst our blue and white European-inspired decor, and the outfit flared beautifully during all the dance turns. She had her mehndi applied on the same outdoor green bench she grew u
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | p playing on —a moment so tender that even the sun seemed to pause to watch. From there, the festivities swept everyone into the luxurious embrace of Omni La Costa Resort in Carlsbad . Thanks to the artistry of Eventspell , every detail radiated intention and elegance—each vignette curated to reflect Ruhi & Akash’s aesthetic and cultural fusion. JnJ Florals elevated the atmosphere with floral work that felt alive. Their arrangements danced in color, adding texture, warmth, and dimension across all three events. Combined with rentals from Team Impulse Events , the entire setting became an immersive canvas of art and emotion. And then came the performances—courtesy of Adaa Dance Academy —a series of beautifully choreographed numbers. When the wedding day arrived, the energy shifted into some
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | thing equally powerful but distinctly serene. Exchanging handwritten vows became Ruhi’s most cherished moment—deeply grounding, beautifully vulnerable, and a reminder that the heart of a wedding is always the love shared between two people. Speaking of cinematic, this entire celebration could have been a film. And thanks to Balerina Films , it practically became one. With their signature unobtrusive style and immaculate storytelling, they captured every fleeting glance, every teardrop, every explosive color moment, and every glitter-soaked dance in a way that felt both editorial and deeply personal. From Seema Gujral’s sangeet glam to Rachit Khanna’s regal wedding couture to the glowing artistry of Makiaj and Drea V Makeup , every fashion and beauty detail enhanced the celebration’s visual
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | language—effortless elegance with a dash of “oh wow.” The one-stop service place for bridal hair & makeup from Dimpsi Mehndi gave her a stunning look. She truly shone with her bridal look. Ruhi dazzled in her Sulakshana Monga royal blue reception gown, embodying elegance and sparkle from head to toe. And then a glitter cannon showered Ruhi & Akash in a sparkling cascade. Dancing under a rainfall of shimmer, surrounded by the people they love, was a moment the bride says she’ll never forget. Honestly, who could? Throughout the night, 3D Sounds kept the dance floor alive, shifting seamlessly from high-energy baraat beats earlier in the festivities to electrifying reception mixes that had multiple generations sharing the dance floor. When hunger struck, guests enjoyed the flavors of Mantra a
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | nd Manohar Delhi Palace , blending tradition with indulgence in a menu that felt like a culinary love letter. Ruhi & Akash’s wedding was more than stunning design. More than luxury details. More than choreography, couture, or cannons of color and glitter. It was a heartfelt tribute to heritage, home, family, and love—a celebration where every choice reflected who they are. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? In 2021, we were both busy in medical residency while also trying to date. I was in coastal Ventura while Akash was living in Las Vegas. We matched on Hinge and met up at a Mexican restaurant in Costa Mesa for our first date. The conversation lasted hours, and we felt like we had known each other forever. We vowed during that date that we would see each
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | other every 2 weeks and make long-distance work. Soon, the only thing getting me through residency was his FaceTimes at the end of the long day. I had never met someone so caring, funny, and genuine, and I knew that this was a once-in-a-lifetime type of love. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Akash knew he wanted to propose to me before we finished residency, which was a whole operation, as Akash was still living in Las Vegas. Akash teamed up with one of my best friends to create a plan. My friend who recently got engaged told me she wanted to do a photoshoot with her closest friends in Palos Verdes. This was believable because she was also a professional photographer and seemed like something she would do. I, fully believing I was there for her photoshoot, arrived at this beautiful
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | location with my 3 best friends greeting me. My friends then walked me to the proposal spot, a gazebo full of flowers and candles overlooking the ocean. Akash was waiting for me underneath, and I could not believe this was my proposal. My family and friends then surprised me with champagne and flowers, and we enjoyed the beautiful sunny day with stunning ocean views. It was such a beautiful moment having my 3 best friends walk me over to my future husband at our proposal spot – such a good blend of a romantic moment with my husband as well as a culmination of all of the feelings with my best friends being with me through all of the years. Afterwards, Akash added more to the surprise and had an after-party at my childhood home in Irvine with all of my closest family and friends, with a live
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | pasta station and an open bar. I could not believe Akash pulled this all off! Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. When I envisioned our wedding, I dreamed of a joyous experience that felt like us in every detail. I wanted a mehndi and haldi in my childhood home in Irvine, CA. I got my mehndi done on the same outdoor green bench that I grew up playing on, which was such a special moment. Since our proposal was overlooking the ocean, I wanted a different, greener, nature-filled vibe for our wedding. I immediately loved Omni La Costa in Carlsbad because it allowed us to have 3 different beautiful locations for all of our events. It was also nice as it felt l
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ike a mini destination, as most family and friends were from Orange County. I knew I wanted an outdoor sangeet where guests felt like they were dancing under the stars. For the wedding, I knew I wanted vibrant colored decor and a color cannon along with a raised aisle. It was so beautiful seeing the color cannon amongst the palm trees and the ponds in the background. For my mehndi, I wore a traditional green outfit, but I added flair with a voluminous braid with pink flowers and a pearl paranda. For my other outfit choices, I chose non-traditional choices. For Haldi, I wore an orange sharara with a dupatta flowing from the back of it. For sangeet, I wore a coral red outfit that was perfect for sangeet as it stood out amongst our blue and white European-inspired decor, and the outfit flared
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | so beautifully during all of the dance turns. For my wedding, I chose pink, and for the reception, I chose royal blue. For my hair and makeup looks, I came in with specific pictures of hair and makeup, but I also let the hair and makeup artists give their own input as well, which I think, in turn, created such a variety of looks. I also had two different hair and makeup teams for my events, which I think ended up working out so beautifully, as every look felt really unique. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I knew I wanted a pink bridal lehenga, but I wanted it to still look very royal. The lehenga had intricate embroidery that featured flowers and bird,s which I felt was so unique. When I wore it for the first time, both of our
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | parents and my sister in law could not stop looking at it and I knew it was the one. I combined light emerald green jewelry which gave a beautiful contrast. The dupatta was a slightly darker shade of pink and featured embroidery on it. My favorite element was the dainty kaleera, which had butterflies falling from it, which felt so elegant. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? I loved planning all of the dance performances at our wedding. We even did a dance at our Haldi with my cousin sister and my sister in law, which was so special. I loved doing a dance with my mom and then also performing my bridal solo dance, which was a surprise for my husband, Akash. I loved seeing his face in excitement and surprise. Akash even learned multiple dances with me for sang
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | eet and reception, and he is not a dancer at all, but he did an amazing jo,b and it was so sweet of him to be so involved in dances for me. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? My guests loved the wedding ceremony and the vibrant colored decor, the exchange of personal vows, and the color cannon at the end. They cannot stop talking about the color cannon and how it was the perfect finale for the wedding ceremony. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? On our wedding day, I entered with my brothers under a floral canopy down a set of stairs, which was so special. Our ceremony combined both our traditions of Marathi culture with Rajasthani elements. Exchanging handwritten vows was my favorite moment—it was deeply personal
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | , grounding us in the midst of tradition. For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. The Haldi was so special to me because my mother DIY'd all of the decor in the courtyard of my childhood home and it turned out so, so beautiful! She ordered wooden planks, nailed them together, and painted them white herself. She then adorned flowers to strings and hung them on the structures. She ordered beautiful florals and a platform stage to complete the look. Then her friends came over and decorated the house with flower pots and other beautiful decor. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? Looking back, I realize our wedding was less about perfect décor or timelines and more about the feelings
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | we created. My advice to future brides is simple: design for the emotions you want people to carry home. Trends fade, but the magic of shared laughter, happy tears, and a packed dance floor—that will stay with you forever. Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) We loved doing a champagne tower pouring with our closest friends cheering us on in the background. It was such a high-energy moment and so perfect sharing an intimate moment with them before the reception begun. If this love story swept you away, join us tomorrow for more magic and inspiration for your story.

Perfectly portioned bites, thoughtful packaging, and refreshing treats ensured everyone was energized for the adventures ahead. In the afternoon, attendees fanned out across Santa Barbara for immersive off-site excursions. Some explored rolling vineyards and coastal estates, while others enjoyed artful tastings, Christmas activities, and curated cultural experiences. Each excursion felt like a mini-retreat—an opportunity to connect, recharge, and experience the rich beauty of the region. Back at the resort, on-site experiences transformed the property into a playground of discovery. From wellness activations to craft stations, boutique gifting, tastings, beauty touch-ups, and hands-on creative sessions,

Fashionable silhouettes, glowing smiles, and sparkling glasses created an atmosphere of pure celebration. With the Pacific as the backdrop, the evening felt effortlessly glamorous—California chic at its finest. The reveal of the gala space left guests breathless. Dramatic lighting, towering floral installations, richly layered textures, and meticulously styled tablescapes combined to create an atmosphere that was both modern and enchanting.

From the moment guests arrived, the tone was set: vibrant, glamorous, and effortlessly chic with a splash of “we’re definitely in paradise.” The brilliant minds at iRock Weddings and Hype Travel crafted an experience that blended seamless planning with a jet-setter’s touch.

Think bold florals, sculptural installations, and the kind of mandap that belongs on a mood board titled “This Is What Dreams Look Like.” Of course, no Indian wedding is complete without music that gets the ground vibrating, and DJ Sahil Patel and MC Krupesh Ray absolutely delivered. Between their high-energy DJ sets and hype-driven baraat performances, the groom’s entrance felt more like a festival headliner moment. And honestly? We weren’t mad about it. As the celebrations continued, Cinderella Bridez ensured Kiran looked like she stepped out of a modern bridal fairytale—with soft glam, radiant tones, and that timeless elegance that translate

Meanwhile, Lemons and Mehndi turned artistry into storytelling, adorning the bride with intricate henna that highlighted her personality and culture in every swirl.

If weddings had soundtracks, Inspire wrote the score. Every sparkle, every glow, every frame felt intentional—an atmosphere perfectly designed for Saptapadi Studio to work its video magic capturing all the joyful, emotional, and unforgettable moments, from the ocean breeze brushing through ceremony vows to the dance floor igniting under warm Cabo nights.
