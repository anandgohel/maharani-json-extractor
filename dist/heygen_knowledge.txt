Daytona Beach, FL Indian Wedding by Sona Photography November 25, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Nirali & Darshak met in September 2021, the modern way—on the Indian dating app Mirchi. She had just moved to Dallas, and he lived in Detroit, but their long-distance connection felt anything but distant. “It was effortless,” Nirali recalls. “We shared the same values, loved travel and food, and he consistently showed up for me.” Darshak planned the perfect proposal in Dubai, one of Nirali’s favorite cities. With the Burj Khalifa glowing at sunset, Bollywood songs playing, and a private rooftop dinner,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | he got down on one knee. “It felt like a Yash Chopra movie,” she says. “It was the Bollywood proposal of my dreams.” The couple originally planned a five-event wedding weekend in October 2024 at the Hilton Daytona Beach Oceanfront Resort . But just two days before celebrations began, Hurricane Milton struck, forcing a full cancellation. “It was heartbreaking,” Nirali says. “But our friends, family, and vendor team were incredible.” They rescheduled for May 2025, and the dream wedding came to life with even more love and gratitude. Nirali’s bridal look was rooted in tradition. “I always wanted to wear red,” she says. During a shopping trip to India, she found her lengha—the very first one she tried on. “I knew it was the one when I saw my family’s reaction.” Of all the wedding memories, the
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | first look stands out. “I was above him, quietly walking to our photo spot. When I tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around—it was a moment I’ll never forget.” Her advice for future brides? “Stay true to what feels right for you and your partner. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, but focus on what really matters—celebrating your love.” From a dating app match to a beachfront wedding with Bollywood flair, Nirali & Darshak’s journey is a true testament to resilience, romance, and the power of love—even when plans don’t go as planned. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? We met the modern way - by swiping right on an Indian dating app, Mirchi. We matched in September 2021. Darshak was living in Detroit and I had just moved to Dallas at the time. Fortunately,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | he worked remotely which allowed him to visit me in Dallas frequently. We quickly learned that we had a shared passion for adventure, travel, and great food. I knew he was the one because our connection felt effortless from the very beginning. We shared the same values and communicated openly. He consistently showed up for me in meaningful ways. There was a sense of calm and certainty with him. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Darshak planned a trip to Dubai, one of my favorite places in the world. One evening, he surprised me with a romantic dinner on a rooftop overlooking the Burj Khalifa at sunset. We enjoyed the most beautiful view and a delicious meal while all my favorite Bollywood songs played in the background. It felt like a scene out of a Yash Chopra movie. Then, he got d

Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. Once we got engaged, we went into full planning mode. Planning a wedding weekend with 5 events is not for the weak! We wanted all the celebrations to reflect both our personalities, so we focused on blending tradition with a modern touch. Choosing the right venue was our top priority, and we were lucky to find Hilton Daytona Beach Oceanfront Resort. We knew that our families and guests would love being right on the beach. Our wedding was originally planned for October 2024, but just two days before the start of the celebrations, H
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | urricane Milton hit Florida, forcing us to cancel everything at the very last minute. It was chaotic and extremely heartbreaking. What was meant to be the start of the most special week of our lives suddenly turned into a whirlwind of stress, uncertainty, and disappointment. But in the midst of all the chaos, we quickly realized how strong our support system was. Our family and friends, near and far, went above and beyond to lift our spirits. We rescheduled our events to May 2025. Through all the chaos, I had the most incredible vendor team by my side. From the moment we had to reschedule, they were nothing but supportive, handling everything with grace and care. They went above and beyond—every event was flawlessly executed. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | have a favorite color in mind? We flew to India to do our wedding shopping. I knew I always wanted to wear a red lengha. My wedding lengha ended up being the first lengha I tried on. I knew it was the one as soon as I put it on and saw my family's reaction! What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? I had been dreaming about my wedding for a very long time. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the planning process was the fact that I was able to do it with Darshak. We learned a lot about each other through the process, in a good way. We had a lot of late night conversations about how we envisioned all our events. We also had the best vendor team who all worked tremendously hard to make our vision come to life. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that con
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | stantly replays in your mind? Our first look was a special moment. I was on the upper level, staying hidden and making my way to the spot for our photos, while he was on the ground level. He was completely unaware that I was just above him, moving alongside. Once our photographers had him in place, I came down, tapped him on his shoulder. When he turned around, we shared a special moment of seeing each other in our wedding outfits for the first time! Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? Stay true to what feels right for you and your partner. Wedding planning can be overwhelming, so remember to take moments to breathe and enjoy the whole process. Surround yourself with people who support you.

Eight years later, here we are.” There wasn’t a single “aha” moment for Cynthia—it was a series of small, meaningful gestures that built a solid foundation. “He’d surprise me with coffee during finals,” she recalls, “and he met all thirteen of my ‘immediate’ family members just a few months in.” True to their low-key and heartfelt style, the proposal was private and deeply personal. A few days before Christmas, they took their dog to a holiday light show drive-thru and sipped hot chocolate as they admired the displays.

Their wedding ceremony was a heartfelt fusion of cultures, held beneath an elegant mandap overlooking the ocean—a perfect reflection of their shared journey and blended traditions. One of the biggest hits of the celebration? The music. With a fusion wedding that brought together two cultural backgrounds, Cynthia & David wanted everyone to feel at home on the dance floor. “

SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Baltimore, MD Indian Wedding by Nayeem Vohra Photography November 21, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments When it comes to love stories that blend elegance, emotion, and a touch of sparkle, Shikha & Vipul’s Baltimore wedding was pure perfection. Think panoramic waterfront views, five-star flair, and a celebration so artfully curated it could double as a masterclass in modern Indian luxury. Their love story began with a match on Coffee Meets Bagel —a digital twist on the classic “boy meets girl.” Their journey to “I do” unfolded over an unforgettable weekend that reflected both grandeur and heart. The festivities kicked off with a vibrant sangeet at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront , where the air buzzed with dhol beats, laughter, and choreographed joy. Shikha choreographed most of the evenin
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | g and performed in nearly half the dances herself—her energy lighting up the stage. Events By Vaishali , the creative force behind the wedding’s seamless flow, transformed every space into a reflection of elegance and celebration. The décor by Partyland Sajawat was a feast for the senses. Sachi didn’t just bring a vision to life—she turned Pinterest dreams into an experience even more breathtaking than imagined. When the big day arrived, the Four Seasons Hotel Baltimore became the stage for Shikha & Vipul’s stunning ceremony overlooking the harbor, with sunlight streaming in like a divine blessing. Shikha, radiant in a handcrafted Nitika Gujral ensemble, exuded grace and modern Maharani allure. Her bridal glow was perfected by Style by Susmita , whose calm, artistic touch made every moment
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | effortlessly elegant. From her intricate Om Sons Bridal Store jewelry to her serene smile, every detail spoke of joy and confidence. Vipul’s grand baraat—led by Premier Entertainment —was pure celebration. His procession danced its way from the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront to the Four Seasons, framed by the sparkling Inner Harbor. In a special twist, Shikha made a surprise cameo from a terrace overlooking the lively crowd, a cinematic prelude to their vows. Their ceremony music by Pavan Verma added a soulful layer to the moment. He played “Madhanya” on the flute as Shikha made her entrance, filling the air with emotion. The ceremony itself was filled with laughter, reverence, and the kind of heartfelt glances that make time stand still. The ballroom shimmered under chandeliers, with a cu
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | stom dance floor by GoToShout setting the stage for nonstop revelry. Premier Entertainment once again kept the energy alive, ensuring guests danced until the very last beat. Culinary perfection came courtesy of Moghul Catering , who honored both Punjabi and Telugu traditions with exquisite dishes that had guests raving long after the weekend ended. But what truly set this wedding apart was its warmth. Despite the grandeur, every moment felt deeply personal—woven together with family, intention, and love. Shikha credits her parents for being her ultimate teammates: her mother’s calm wisdom and her father’s logistical brilliance turned planning into a family art form. From late-night checklist sessions to “Tetris-packing” a moving truck, every bit of this wedding was built with heart. And of
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | course, every stunning second was immortalized by Nayeem Vohra Photography , whose artistry turned fleeting emotions into timeless treasures. From Bhavna’s Henna -adorned hands to every dance floor spin, their lens captured the soul of the celebration. From heartfelt vows to sangeet sparkle, this Baltimore wedding was more than an event—it was a celebration of two souls intertwining, a masterclass in blending North and South Indian cultures with style, substance, and sincerity. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? We met the good old-fashioned way...reaching for the same jalapeno in a grocery store.. Just kidding, we met on a dating app called Coffee Meets Bagel! After we matched, instead of small talk about the weather & our favorite colors, he immediately
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | messaged asking to meet in person at a really cute cocktail bar in Philly called One Tippling Place. Our first date had some eavesdroppers who were sitting next to us & when he went to the restroom, they tapped me on the shoulder and were shocked that we were only on a first date! Even though it was a "school night," we closed the bar down & the rest was history. Even though I'll never admit it to him, I knew he was the one pretty early on. I was in my GI fellowship at the time which can be really demanding, and he was endlessly supportive. From the start, we dated with intention. Every conversation, including the serious ones, only brought us closer. Nothing scared him off & if anything, it made us both even more excited for what was to come! Tell us how you went about planning your weddi

We actually started planning our wedding before we were even engaged! Having attended so many weddings together, we quickly became experts in what worked (and what we’d do differently). Through those experiences, we organically discovered many of our own vendors. We started a little backward by hunting for venues first. After touring multiple options, we ultimately chose a beautiful location at the Inner Harbor in Baltimore - perfectly situated between both sides of our families. Our vision was for everyone to move into the hotel for the entire weekend so that it felt like one big family reunion rather than a series of separate events. We did everything but the wedd
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ing ceremony at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, which is where all our guests were staying. The baraat was super fun since it walked my husband's side from the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, where they were staying, to the wedding venue at the Four Seasons with the backdrop of the Inner Harbor! I even got to pop out of one of the Four Seasons' terraces that overlooked the baraat walk for a quick cameo!! By the time we found our wedding planner - Events By Vaishali, we already had the venue booked - but she was truly our saving grace. Her team coordinated every vendor, handled all the moving parts, and, most importantly, ensured the weekend ran seamlessly. I was able to completely hand over my stress (and my phone!) to them and just be present during the weekend. It wasn’t until after th
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | e weekend that I learned about all the little fires they’d quietly put out behind the scenes like true professionals. Our planner also introduced me to my makeup artist, Style By Susmita, with whom I connected instantly. She has such a gift for enhancing your natural beauty and creating a calm, grounded energy - which is so important, especially since you spend more time with your hair and makeup team than almost anyone else during the wedding weekend! My planner also introduced me to my mehndi artist, who was equally incredible. We did a long Zoom consultation where she designed my patterns on an iPad. She spent over nine hours doing my full bridal mehndi but kept up the most positive, warm energy the entire time - it felt more like spending the day with a close friend than with a vendor.
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Our decorator, Sachi from PartylandSajawa, turned from vendor to fast friend. She completely understood our vision and brought it to life with such attention to detail. Each event felt so distinct yet cohesive. She had this rare ability to take my Pinterest dreams and translate them into something even more beautiful than I imagined. Our photographer was Nayeem Vohra, whom I met at my best friend's wedding over 5 years ago. I knew from that moment that he was going to be my photographer before I even had a man or a date selected. The universe was in my favor that he happened to be free! His team has an incredible way of making you feel comfortable in front of the camera, and he always gets the best shot! Our caterer was Mogul Catering, which was out of this world! I am Punjabi, and my hus
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | band is Telugu so it was important for us to both have our cultures represented. During our tasting, Mogul made sure to have us try special dishes from both parts of India and absolutely came through during our weekend. Our guests could not stop raving about it!! As a dancer, our musical talent was of the utmost importance. We used Premier DJs, HR Beats, and Ambition. They knew the vibe we needed for all four events, and we didn't have a single repeated song all weekend! Our planner also recommended Pawan Varma, who is a flautist & saxophonist. He brought such a unique energy to our baraat, wedding & reception. He played "Madhanya" on his flute for my bridal entrance and played saxophone covers of all our favorite Bollywood songs during the baraat & cocktail hour! The outfit process was a
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | whirlwind! We traveled to India for just a few days, so I had to make every minute count. I had done tons of research beforehand, but between choosing my own looks and helping my sister find hers, it was an adventure. Susmita, my makeup artist, was incredibly helpful even from afar, guiding me to pick outfits that complemented one another while still being unique for each event. Special shout-out to both my parents who never left my side during the shopping marathon. We also got a chance to custom make our bridal party outfits with Meetu Makkad in Shahpur Jat, which was such a cool & unique process! And finally, the heart of it all, my family. My mom was my rock throughout the entire planning process. Together, we mastered the Notes app like pros, creating shared to-do lists and weekly che

My mom had this magical way of balancing logistics and emotions - she kept us organized, grounded and laughing through it all. Every little moment of our wedding had its fingerprints on it, from the tiniest décor details to the thoughtful guest experiences. My dad was instrumental in execution, helping us expertly pack inventory into bins in the months leading up to everything, and Tetris packing a huge moving truck without missing a single piece. It truly became a family project filled with so much love, teamwork, and joy. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? The best part of the planning process was doing it together. We only had 6 months from our proposal to our wedding day, but we got through it all together!
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Things can definitely get stressful at times since there are so many moving parts but having each other through it all made it feel fun and meaningful. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? The wedding weekend goes by in a complete blur - everyone tells you that, but you don’t really believe it until you’re in it. For me, the one moment that felt like time actually stopped was in between our wedding ceremony and reception. Vipul and I had about an hour completely to ourselves, and it was the first time all weekend that things felt quiet. We just sat together, taking it all in - everything we’d planned, everyone we loved, and the fact that we were finally married. It reminded me that all of it, the planning, the details, the celebration,s wa
