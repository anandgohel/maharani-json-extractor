Engage!25 Santa Barbara — Day 3 December 12, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Day 3 at Engage!25 Santa Barbara unfolded like the crescendo of a perfectly orchestrated symphony—each moment layered with creativity, connection, and coastal magic. Set against the breathtaking backdrop of the Ritz-Carlton Bacara , the day moved effortlessly from education to immersion and ended with a gala that can only be described as spectacular. The final day began with powerful conversations designed to ignite purpose and possibility. In the first round of breakout sessions, attendees gathered to absorb expert insights on business growth, elevated

As the educational portion of the day wrapped, guests enjoyed a beautifully curated grab-and-go lunch that combined convenience with signature Engage! polish. Perfectly portioned bites, thoughtful packaging, and refreshing treats ensured everyone was energized for the adventures ahead. In the afternoon, attendees fanned out across Santa Barbara for immersive off-site excursions. Some explored rolling vineyards and coastal estates, while others enjoyed artful tastings, Christmas activities, and curated cultural experiences. Each excursion felt like a mini-retreat—an opportunity to connect, recharge, and experience the rich beauty of the region. Back at the resort, on-site experiences transformed the proper

From wellness activations to craft stations, boutique gifting, tastings, beauty touch-ups, and hands-on creative sessions, every corner offered something magical.

As golden hour kissed the coastline, attendees gathered for a sunset cocktail hour that radiated elegance.

Her lens didn’t just document—it narrated, translated, and elevated, turning candid moments into fine-art portraits against the city’s iconic skyline. The celebration began at the historic Ferry Building for a sangeet that looked like a modern Indian soirée dipped in golden hour magic. Under its soaring archways, Vaishnavi arrived wrapped in jewel-tone elegance, shimmering in the soft eveni

NC Event Designs transformed the space with rich textures, floral detailing, and warm candlelight that played beautifully across the heritage brick wall s—m elding old-world architecture with contemporary celebration. The following morning, San Francisco’s Financial District got the wake-up call of a lifetime. Parth’s baraat burst through the streets with dhol beats echoing between skyscrapers, turning the city into a living soundbox. Office workers peered out of windows. Tourists pulled out their phones. Dogs barked in supportive confusion. And there was Parth—absolut

With panoramic skyline views framing the mandap, the ceremony became an ode not just to tradition, but to the city that shaped their love story. NC Event Designs crafted a floral and décor experience that was equal parts modern simplicity and serene beauty— clean lines, monochrome florals, and airy draping that allowed the skyline to be the true showstopper. Lesya's portraits in this space? Insanely gorgeous. The kind you stare at and think, “This belongs in a gallery… or at least as my phone wallpaper.” The reception followed, embracing a minimalist palette inspired by the Indian monsoon season—soft blues, smoky greys, rain-washed greens

The room looked like a modern poem: moody, atmospheric, and intentionally understated so that every moment, every embrace, and every dance step became the focal point. One of the most touching layers of the celebration came from behind the camera. Parth, a wedding videographer himself, entrusted his own team—including Tagironva Weddings and Parth Productions —to step into the storyteller role he is so often responsible for. It was a beautiful exchange of trust, respect, and artistic camaraderie. The result was a visual narrative that felt deeply personal, as though every clip was filmed with the same love the couple shares. From iconic architecture to intimate traditions, from sweeping skylines to tiny emotional details caught between vows, Vaishnavi &
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Parth’s celebration honored the heart of Indian weddings while boldly embracing contemporary design and city life. It was modern yet meaningful, grand yet grounded, refined yet joyfully chaotic in the way only big Indian families can achieve. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? Parth and I first met on the collegiate raas-garba circuit. We were on competing teams—his was better, but I’ll only say that once. He came to perform at a competition my school was hosting, and I was part of the board organizing it. When I saw him in a practice room, something just clicked. It's a little cheesy, but I had a feeling right away that he was the one. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Our proposal took place in the pouring rain in NYC. While that might sound chaotic
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | to some, it felt incredibly meaningful—my parents were married during monsoon season, so the rain made the moment feel beautifully full-circle. We were supposed to be heading to dinner, and since I have the navigational instincts of a hawk, I realized pretty quickly that our Uber was going off-course. Moments later, we stopped at the sweetest little gazebo, where Parth proposed. The next morning, he surprised me again by renting out the top floor of Rockefeller Center for our engagement photos. It was intimate, thoughtful, and absolutely perfect Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. We planned our four-day Indian wedding in under nine months from across the
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | country, so trust me—it’s possible. We had always imagined a spring wedding in San Francisco, and watching every detail fall into place was so rewarding. We wanted the overall vibe to be elegant and minimal (or as minimal as a four-day Indian wedding can actually be). One of our favorite choices was hosting our garba at the SF Ferry Building. For anyone from the Bay Area, it’s such an iconic spot, and getting to celebrate there with all our loved ones felt really special. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I went into dress shopping with only two requirements: simple and elegant—very on brand for me. I also knew I didn’t want anything super bright; I’ve never been someone who loves being the center of attention. After five full d
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ays of searching in Mumbai, we walked into Neeru’s Prive right as a lengha was being taken off the display. The moment I saw the cream beaded skirt, I just knew. We customized the blouse and both dupattas, and I paired it with mehndi-green jewelry to match Parth. In the end, it was everything I had hoped for and more. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? Honestly, the most enjoyable part was discovering how well Parth and I work as a team. Our interests couldn’t be more different, so dividing up wedding tasks became shockingly easy. It was our first big project together, and realizing I could genuinely count on him to handle his part—and handle it well—was such a meaningful moment for me. Seeing everything come to life afterward was the cherry on top. What did
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | your guests particularly love about your Wedding? I think our guests really appreciated the thoughtfulness behind each event—from the venues and décor to the food and the performances. We tried to make every detail feel intentional. Hopefully they felt like they could see pieces of our relationship woven into everything, and that it made the celebrations feel personal and special to them as well. For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. Welcome Dinner: We kicked things off with an intimate welcome dinner in a hotel ballroom with just our closest family and friends. The highlight was our sensational pizza truck (@rollwithgigi—you were a hit). I wore a beautiful red beaded sharara from Panache
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | by Sharmeen. Opal & Ivy transformed the space into a rustic Italian dream—complete with tomatoes as centerpieces. Garba: Our garba took place in the iconic SF Ferry Building, which felt especially meaningful since Parth and I first met on a raas-garba team. It was our most personal event, filled with family performances and our first dance together—the only one we did all weekend. I wore a dark green brocade lengha with the softest cancan (a must for dancing all night). The décor was whimsical and garden-inspired, filled with pinks, purples, greens, and yellows that brought the whole space to life. Receptions: For the reception, we celebrated in the indoor space of the SF Metreon. NC Event Designs absolutely transformed the venue—draping the entire space in soft cream curtains and creating
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | long banquet tables that opened into a black-and-white checkered dance floor. The layout was unconventional for a reception but ended up being perfect for a night full of dancing and drinks. I wore a simple black pre-draped saree for the first half of the night before changing into a black bejeweled Indo-Western suit, both by Sureena Chowdhri. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? There’s no “right” way to be a bride. Whether you love the spotlight or would rather avoid it, whether you want 500 guests or 50, whether you care more about décor or food—it’s all completely okay. Trust your instincts and try not to let the outside noise sway you. If you feel happy and at ease on your wedding day, it will show, and everything else becomes secondary.
