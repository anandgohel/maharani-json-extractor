Riviera Maya, MX Indian Wedding by Saptapadi Weddings January 2, 2026 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some love stories begin with a carefully planned first date. Others—like Akilah & Ankur’s —are written entirely by fate, with zero regard for itineraries, backup plans, or what could have been. Kismet isn’t just a word in their story; it’s the headline. They met exactly where destiny intended: Cancun. Akilah was celebrating her birthday with friends, Ankur was there for a friend’s birthday of his own, and despite staying at different resorts (and originally planning completely different trips), their paths crossed at a conc
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ert. One moment, one conversation, one unmistakable spark—and suddenly, everything else made sense. Akilah describes Ankur as her manifestation in human form, the embodiment of everything she had hoped for in a partner. When you know, you really do know. Fast forward to March 2024, when Akilah thought she was heading home for an award ceremony honoring her brother. Instead, she walked into a breathtaking botanical garden filled with the soft sound of a violin—and Ankur, on one knee. As if that wasn’t enough, the celebration continued with a surprise gathering of their closest family and friends. Subtlety was clearly never part of Ankur’s plan, and honestly, we wouldn’t have it any other way. So when it came time to plan their wedding, it felt only fitting that their celebration would retur
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | n to the place where it all began—Mexico. Hosted in the sun-soaked beauty of the Riviera Maya, their fusion destination wedding was a masterclass in intentional planning, cultural harmony, and joy multiplied by ocean views. With the expert guidance of Indian Destination Wedding, Inc. , a Platinum Guide member known for making the impossible feel effortless, Akilah and Ankur found the perfect venue and ensured their guests were seamlessly taken care of from arrival to farewell. That journey led them to Generations Riviera Maya , where the turquoise sea, lush surroundings, and warm hospitality created a breathtaking setting for every event. From there, Pyaar Planning stepped in and truly became the biggest advocates. From coordinating pre-wedding visits for makeup trials and menu tastings to
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | curating a vendor dream team across Mexico, their planning and design ensured that every detail reflected Akilah and Ankur’s personalities and cultures in perfect balance. The décor told a story all its own. K'ndy Flowers transformed each space with lush florals, elegant textures, and thoughtful details that felt both elevated and welcoming—never overdone, always intentional. The result? A visual experience that felt immersive without ever overshadowing the emotion of the moments unfolding. Akilah’s bridal beauty was radiant and refined, thanks to Beauty Experts , who perfected a look that celebrated her natural glow while complementing the tropical setting. From soft glam to statement moments, every look felt confident, timeless, and completely her. Energy levels stayed sky-high thanks t
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | o Empire Entertainment , who brought the perfect mix of beats, baraat excitement, and dance-floor magic. Add in the vibrant flair of La Hora Loca, and you have the kind of party guests talk about long after their return flights land. One of the most meaningful layers of the celebration was how seamlessly cultures blended—not just in décor and fashion, but in spirit. From the ceremonies led by Pandit Bernardo to the artistry of Loto Mehndi , every tradition was honored with intention and heart. Guests didn’t just attend a wedding—they experienced a true fusion of families, backgrounds, and life chapters colliding most beautifully. And because no Maharani Weddings feature is complete without unforgettable visuals, Federico Salmeron Photography captured every emotional glance, joyful embrace,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | and sun-drenched celebration with an editorial eye that feels both timeless and alive. On the cinematic side, Saptapadi Studios , a Platinum Guide favorite, preserved the movement, music, and magic of the weekend in a way that will let Akilah and Ankur relive it all for years to come. Akilah’s words of wisdom for future brides say it best: pause, breathe, and soak it all in. The little things fade. The feeling stays. And if this Riviera Maya fusion celebration is any indication, the feeling was nothing short of extraordinary. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? Kismet- that’s the essence of our story and relationship. We met purely by fate! I was in Cancun celebrating my birthday with friends, while Ankur was there with his own group celebrating a friend's

I was originally supposed to go to Cabo and even planned to attend a different concert on another day, but fate had other plans. I knew he was the one when I realized that he was my manifestation and everything I dreamed and hoped for in a partner. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! In March 2024, I went back to my hometown for what was supposed to be an award ceremony honoring my brother. Instead, I was taken to a breathtaking botanical garden, where the sweet sound of a violin filled the air, and there was Ankur down on one knee. After the photo shoot, the surprise continued when Ankur took me to another location where our closest family and friends

They were our biggest advocates who went above and beyond to bring our vision to life.

With their connections across Mexico, we were introduced to some of the most talented vendors who helped create the perfect fusion of our cultures and

From the moment that they arrived, they expressed that they were in absolute awe, and while the ocean and resort set a tone, they weren't the only breathtaking factors. They especially appreciated the attention to detail that was woven into every part of each day. It was the fresh flowers, elegant decor, captivating performances, the receptions prior to our ceremonies, and the variety in the selection of food.

Some develop slowly, like a handwritten letter you cherish for years. Others ignite in an instant, turning ordinary moments into something truly special. Rashi & Yash's story lives beautifully in both worlds, and their wedding was the kind of celebration that makes you believe the universe really does have a flair for timing. Set entirely outdoors at the breathtaking Hilton Santa Barbara Beachfront Resort , the celebration unfolded like a love letter to California itself—golden light, ocean air, and that unmistakable sense of ease that makes everything feel just a little more romantic. Behind the scenes, the impeccable planning and design by Amora Even
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ts ensured that every moment felt intentional without ever feeling overproduced. Their vision came to life through the soft, romantic florals by Blooming Bliss Design , who layered ivory, blush, and dusty mauve blooms into lush arrangements that felt organic, timeless, and perfectly at home against the coastal landscape. And then there was Rashi. Effortlessly elegant, thoughtfully styled, and glowing in a way that felt both bridal and unmistakably her. Her ceremony look featured an ivory lehenga delicately embroidered with elephants and peacocks—traditional artistry that shimmered softly in the coastal breeze. Her beauty look, created by DreaV Makeup , was timeless in the truest sense. Her sleek low bun, whisper-light veil, and emerald jewelry—lovingly assembled by her mother—added layers
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | of meaning and quiet drama that felt deeply personal. For the reception, Rashi stepped into a striking fish-cut Dolly J ensemble sourced directly from Delhi. Structured, modern, and undeniably glamorous, the look shimmered under the evening lights and paired flawlessly with her Gucci heels. Yash matched the moment in a deep green floral-jacquard suit from Hive & Colony , finished with a Gucci bow tie. The celebration shifted seamlessly into evening mode with black accents through dinnerware, velvet linens, and fashion choices, while elegant chandeliers—made possible by Silverio Party Rentals —cast a warm glow over the dance floor. The atmosphere was elevated but never stiff, chic yet joyful, with lighting and music by 3D Sounds keeping the energy perfectly balanced between romance and cele
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | bration. The ceremony itself honored both Jain and Marathi traditions with thoughtful intention. The pandit ensured that every ritual was understood and felt, while modern choices reinforced the couple’s belief in partnership, equality, and family in all its forms. Rashi’s entrance to “How Far I’ll Go” from Moana was one of those goosebump moments, especially as the lyric “see the line where the sky meets the sea” echoed against the coastline behind Yash. And just when you thought the emotions couldn’t peak any higher, the baraat arrived—joyful, inclusive, and delightfully unexpected. Guests from both families joined in from the start, dancing together to dhol beats, before Yash made a surprise appearance on a white horse along the beachside path. Cheers erupted. Then Rashi appeared from h

A choreographed routine the couple had secretly rehearsed, turning the baraat into a full-blown celebration. Every unforgettable moment was captured with cinematic artistry by Balerina Films , whose storytelling lens preserved not just how the day looked, but how it felt . From sweeping coastal shots to quiet emotional exchanges, their work ensures this wedding will live on beautifully for generations. This wedding was all about meaning. About choosing a place that felt like home, traditions that felt true, and a celebration that honored love in its most intentional form.

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Indianapolis, IN Indian Wedding by WSS Weddings December 30, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some weddings unfold, scene by scene, like a perfectly paced Bollywood blockbuster—where every frame feels intentional, every emotion lands just right, and the audience (a.k.a. the guests) is fully invested from the opening scene. Sanjana & Rohit’s celebration was exactly that kind of cinematic magic, rooted in a love story that
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | began long before wedding planning ever entered the chat. Their story goes all the way back to the 6th-grade orchestra, where a simple introduction sparked an instant childhood crush. Fast forward through years of growing up, growing together, and building a shared rhythm, and it was clear this was always heading somewhere special. Rohit’s proposal sealed the deal in the most heartfelt way—behind Sanjana’s home, in a garden with a clock tower where they once dated, surrounded by family and surprised by best friends flown in just for the moment. Romantic, thoughtful, and deeply personal… the tone was set. That same sense of meaning carried through every detail of their wedding. The festivities began at the stunning JPS Events at Regions Tower , where modern architecture met timeless traditi
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | on. The ceremony space felt elevated in every sense—literally and figuratively—with clean lines, warm florals, and intentional décor framing the mandap. JPS Events didn’t just host the ceremony; they stepped in as décor experts, ensuring each ritual flowed seamlessly. Sitting together on the mandap, bathed in sunlight and surrounded by loved ones, became one of those quiet, sacred moments the couple says will replay in their minds forever. What makes this celebration even more special? It was planned entirely without a formal wedding planner. Instead, Sanjana & Rohit leaned into what mattered most—family. Every relative poured their heart into the details, turning the process into a true labor of love and a celebration of two families becoming one. Their journey even took them to India twi

Speaking of bridal dreams—Sanjana knew from the start that red was non-negotiable. Her bridal lehenga, a rich bougainvillea hue inspired by flowers her mother grew up with in Bangalore, struck the perfect balance between West Coast elegance and Eastern tradition. Designed by Jigar and Nikita , the look was deeply symbolic, right down to the custom veil adorned with butterflies representing Sanjana and a peacock honoring Rohit’s village. Even her mehndi told a story—designed over the course of a year with a dear aunt, featuring portraits of her dogs, village peacocks, and meaningful florals
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | woven into the design. Her jewelry, hand-selected at Curio Cottage , completed a look that felt both intentional and timeless. As the celebrations continued, the mood shifted beautifully. The haldi and mehndi took place in Sanjana’s backyard—an Italian villa–style setting transformed into a sun-soaked celebration filled with yellow hues, joyful color rules for guests, and a relaxed, love-filled atmosphere. Later, the reception at Embassy Suites Noblesville unfolded in rich burgundy and plum tones, with star lights overhead and a room so expansive it practically begged for a party. And yes—they delivered. Ace Party and Tents transformed the space into a whimsical, rave-worthy celebration that guests are still talking about months later. And then there was the dancing in charge of DJ Imalli
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | n . With choreography planned as surprises for each other—and involving siblings on both sides—the performances felt cinematic, polished, and deeply emotional. Sanjana & Rohit brought movie-level energy to the floor, and guests absolutely felt it. Six months later? People are still bringing it up. Food, of course, played its starring role. Madurai Virundhu and Incredible India US delivered flavors that were comforting, indulgent, and unforgettable—the kind of meals guests reminisce about long after the wedding is over. And the celebrations didn’t end there. The following day was wrapped with an intimate lakeside lunch at the in-laws’ home, complete with incredible food and the kind of quiet joy that only comes after an epic few days of celebration.
