Clearwater Beach, FL Indian Wedding by Diego Stuart Films September 12, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Every love story deserves a setting as unforgettable as the couple, and for Deepal & Aanand, that backdrop was none other than the sparkling Gulf of Mexico. Their Indian wedding unfolded like a cinematic masterpiece—equal parts tradition, glamour, and pure joy. There’s something magical about JW Clearwater Beach Resort . From its sleek ballrooms to the panoramic views of endless turquoise waters, it’s the kind of venue that makes every moment feel larger than life. Guests were treated to the best of both world

No story this grand is complete without someone to tell it. Enter Diego Stuart Films , whose cinematic eye turned Deepal & Aanand’s wedding into more than just a memory—it became art.

For Malena & Eshwar, it was the latter. Their unforgettable celebration at Generations Riviera Maya was the kind of wedding that doesn’t just make you say “wow”—it makes you want to grab your passport immediately. None of this magic would have been possible without the expertise of Indian Destination Wedding, Inc. , who ensured every guest’s journey to Mexico was seamless and stress-free. From coordinating flights to handling room blocks and special requests, they took the guesswork out of destination planning. Their concierge-level service allowed the couple to focus on celeb

Every petal, drape, and candle was perfectly placed —proof that paradise can indeed be styled to perfection. Behind the lens, Euphoric Lov e captured each breathtaking moment.

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Seattle, WA Fusion Wedding by Betty Globa Photography September 9, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments When two cultures collide most beautifully, the result is nothing short of spectacular—and Lena & Sachiv’s wedding was exactly that. Blending Indian and Chinese traditions with a love letter to the Pacific Northwest, this celebration was proof that you can have it all: elegance, flavor, heritage, and just a dash of fun. The festivities began at the Center for Urban Horticulture at UW, where guests were welcomed to a vibrant Sangeet night infused with a
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | traditional Chinese tea ceremony. Lena & Sachiv transformed the evening into an all-out Indian dance party. Imagine sipping tea one moment and twirling to Bollywood beats the next—fusion goals, right? The next day, the celebrations shifted to the breathtaking Golf Club at New Castle , where nature’s rolling greens met the sounds of a lively baraat. Simply by Tamara Nicole worked her magic with florals in bold red, orange, and green to symbolize both cultures, while Opal Event Planning and Design ensured every moment flowed seamlessly. Lena chose a stunning bridal lehenga from Nazranaa , perfectly echoing prosperity in both Indian and Chinese cultures. She glowed all evening with the flawless artistry of CYT Makeup and Hair Studio , and every twirl, laugh, and sweet stolen glance was immor

And of course, Lena’s intricate mehndi by Creative Faces tied her bridal look together with a touch of tradition. By her side, Sachiv complemented the moment in traditional attire, looking like they had stepped out of a royal folktale. For the grand finale, the ballroom of the Golf Club at New Castle was transformed into a romantic French country dream, with a Pacific Northwest edge. Guests savored a mix of regional cuisine and sweet delights, from a cake by Lady Grey to a dessert station that kept everyone coming back for seconds (and thirds—don’t judge). Wunderland Events kept the party alive with DJ beats and expert lighting design, turning the ballroom into a dazzling, da

Guests snapped silly moments at the Flash of Fun Photo Booth , while rentals from Grand Event Rentals ensured every table, chair, and glass sparkled in place.

How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? For bridal lengha, Lena chose red for her wedding ceremony outfit from Nazarana, as it is the symbol of weddings in both Indian and Chinese weddings, representing prosperity and good fortune. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? Our guests particularly love the different elements of cultural celebrations and cuisines. From a tea ceremony, an Indian dance party at Sangeet, to a traditional Hindu ceremony and a western reception, including both Indian flavors and local Pacific Northwest ingredients.

My husband and I both come from South Indian families—he’s Tamil and I’m Kannada—so we naturally wanted our wedding to reflect the traditions we grew up with. That became a quiet guide for many of the choices we made throughout the planning process. When we visited Rancho Las Lomas, I was drawn to it immediately. The Portuguese-style architecture—especially the tiled roofs, lush greenery, and all the flowering plants on the property—reminded me of homes I’d seen in South India. It felt like an unexpected but fitting backdrop for the kind of celebration we were imagining. We brought in elements that felt familiar to us—jasmine, ma
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | rigold, tuberose, banana leaves, coconuts, and seasonal fruits like bananas and papayas. These touches helped create an atmosphere that felt rooted and full of meaning. For my bridal look, I wore a red tissue silk saree, similar to what my grandmother, mother, and sister wore as brides. I paired it with traditional Lakshmi temple jewelry and a long braid, which I’ve always associated with South Indian weddings. It felt right to wear something so rooted in tradition—something that connected me to both family and place. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? For my wedding saree, the choice was deeply rooted in tradition. I wanted to follow in the footsteps of the women in my family by wearing a red tissue silk saree—something my grandm
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | other, mother, and sister had all done in their own way. My mom actually picked it out for me while she was in India, and we made the final decision together over a video call. It felt meaningful to carry that continuity forward. I kept the saree traditional and let my makeup and jewelry be where I expressed more of my own style, while still keeping things classic. For the reception, I chose a lehenga from Sari Palace. I knew it would likely be a one-time wear—as bridal lehengas often are—so I wanted something that really made a statement. The gold instantly stood out to me, and when I tried it on, it just felt right. It was bold but elegant, and the kind of outfit that didn’t need much else to shine. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? One of the most enjoya
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ble parts of the planning process was gathering inspiration. We spent time looking through Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok—not in an overwhelming way, but just to get a sense of what felt right for us. It helped us clarify what we were drawn to and how we wanted the day to feel. A moment that really stood out was when we saw the decor mock-up from our vendor, Three Petals, a few weeks before the wedding. It was the first time we saw our ideas take shape in a tangible way. I remember just standing there, not saying much, because it all felt a bit surreal. That was the moment it started to feel real—that this was actually happening. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? Our wedding happened to fall on an especially hot day, and we were conscious of how long our ceremony
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | would be—about two hours—so we tried to think ahead about how to keep guests comfortable. One detail that people kept mentioning afterward was the boba we served during the ceremony, thanks to our vendor, Band Baaja Boba. They worked closely with us to create custom flavors that reflected parts of our story: Mumbai kala khatta lemonade for him, Georgia peach lassi for me, and an Orange County–inspired Arnold Palmer for both of us. It was something small, but it added a personal touch—and on such a warm day, it really made a difference. We loved that it felt thoughtful without being over the top, and our guests appreciated it too. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? The first look, without a doubt. I had a really early start that morning—
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | waking up at 2 a.m.—so by the time we were ready for the first look, I had spent hours sitting with all the anticipation, nerves, and quiet buildup of the day. But the moment I saw my husband, everything shifted. All the noise faded, and I was reminded exactly why we were doing all of this. It grounded me in the best possible way. That moment replays in my mind often—it was calm, emotional, and full of clarity. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? One piece of advice I’d share is to seriously consider working with a wedding planner. There are so many moving parts—big and small—that can be easy to miss, especially when you’re trying to balance vision with logistics. Sometimes you know exactly what you want, but not necessarily who to turn to in order to make it happen. Our plan

They understood our vision and helped connect us with the right vendors, making the entire process feel so much more manageable.

Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) I’m just so grateful for the incredible team of vendors who brought our wedding to life.
