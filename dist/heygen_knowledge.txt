COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Cinnaminson, NJ Indian Wedding by Fine Art Productions November 4, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Ashvini & Kyle’s wedding was the kind of celebration that makes you fall in love with love all over again—an enchanting fusion of color, culture, and charisma wrapped in elegance and topped with just the right dose of sparkle. Set against the sophisticated backdrop of The Merion Catering & Special Events , every detail of this grand affair was a visual poem of romance and heritage. From the vibrant sangeet to the heart-stealing ceremony, every moment was crafted to perfection—and captured with finesse by Fine Art Productions , the masterminds behind the lens who turned fleeting emotions into forever memories. The festivities
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | kicked off with a lively sangeet at King Palace Banquet & Party Hall , where laughter echoed louder than the dhol and dance floors turned into full-blown Bollywood sets. Guests brought their A-game in moves and style (and yes, that one uncle who insists on performing “Tamma Tamma” made a triumphant return). When it came time for the wedding day, The Merion Catering & Special Events transformed into a dreamscape worthy of royalty. Their team not only hosted the event but flawlessly handled the planning, design, and catering—talk about multitasking in style! The couple’s vision of a timeless yet modern Indian wedding came alive thanks to the artistry of Exclusive Events , who once again proved why they’re one of the industry’s most sought-after designers. Our radiant bride, Ashvini, looked

Completing her regal look was the exquisite jewelry from Art Kundan USA , which added that perfect touch of old-world glamour. The magic didn’t stop there. Adding rhythm and energy to the celebration was none other than Kurani Studios, now proudly rebranded as Vibe District —a Platinum Guide member renowned for elevating South Asian weddings to unforgettable experiences. From electrifying DJ sets and mesmerizing live music to vibrant Bollywood performances and mood-setting lighting, their team transformed each event into a cinematic celebration. Whether it was the baraat beats or the high-energy reception tracks, they had guests dancing like no one was watchin
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | g (even though Fine Art Productions absolutely was—and capturing every epic move). Guests were treated to thoughtful details at every turn. Custom stationery from Menaka Card set the tone with elegance, while personalized favors by Thambulaaa Return Gifts added a sweet, heartfelt touch. The mehndi artistry by Aneeta Nashad turned Ashvini’s hands into living works of art. And for guests who traveled from far and wide, The Westin Mount Laurel offered a plush retreat courtesy of a perfectly coordinated travel concierge experience. Every element of this wedding felt like it belonged in a storybook—a celebration not just of two people, but of two families, two cultures, and a shared future bursting with joy.

I met my husband on Valentine’s Day at a meet-up for singles. I knew that day, Kyle was the one because talking to him felt like I’ve known him all my life, and he made me feel so special and seen. ❤️ Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! He surprised me by taking me to the New Jersey botanical gardens and picking a beautiful spot amongst the Lilly pads and greenery, and getting down on one knee. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. Wedding planning went smoothly. With the Merion, our venue, they were great with helping us with our vision and made it so easy
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | for us. Our decorator's exclusive events were also amazing and helped us with our vision while respecting our budget. Raj Kurani from Kurani Studios, as well as his team, were great and worked with me and my family on song selection and schedule when it came to the Sangeet, wedding, and reception. Our Sangeet took place at the King's Palace, and Raj, the co-owner, was very helpful and steered us in the right direction with the menu and decorations. My makeup artist was honestly not what I imagined, but I luckily liked the wedding day makeup and hair, which is all I could ask for, but I do not want to say their name as I do not want to talk negatively about them. Emmy from Aaina fashion in Long Island was a dream to work with for clothes for both me and my husband, and his collection is stu

How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I had a color in mind of burgundy, and Aaina fashion ended up having a beautiful burgundy lengha on display that I fell in love with. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? The most enjoyable part of wedding planning was spending time with my parents throughout because we have some great memories from planning with them that I wouldn’t trade for the world. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? My guests loved the venue, the food, and how welcoming my family was to everyone. Was there a really special moment in your weddi

My first dance with my husband was the most memorable, thanks to Kurani Studios making it feel like a fairy tale, dancing on clouds. For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. The decor was simple from a local decorator in Edison for the Sangeet, and for our Haldi, we did a private event at home that my family helped decorate for. The makeup artist did my hair and makeup for the Sangeet, and I did my own for the Haldi. The dress I wore for the Sangeet was from India, and my Haldi outfit was from Edison and another from Aaina Fashion. For the Sangeet, my husband and I danced to Teri Baaton Mein Aisa Ulijha Jaya, and everyone loved it since it was a big sur

Make sure you do your research and take your time if you can’t. Don’t over-stress yourself with feeling like everything needs to be done all at once. Have a checklist ready for what you need to get done and a timeline, and stick by it; it helps take the pressure off when you see a check of everything you got done. Also, most importantly, remember to have fun; it’s your wedding day, and enjoying it is a must! Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details!

I was in Cancun celebrating my birthday with friends, while Ankur was there with his own group celebrating a friend's birthday. Though we were staying at different resorts, our paths crossed at a concert, which was a meeting that was truly meant to be. I was originally supposed to go to Cabo and even planned to attend a different concert on another day, but fate had other plans. I knew he was the one when I realized that he was my manifestation and everything I dreamed and hoped for in a partner. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story!

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Hamburg, NJ Indian Wedding by Saroj Studios October 31, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments After over a year of planning, Nisha & Rohan’s dream wedding weekend finally arrived—and it was nothing short of spectacular. Hosted at the breathtaking Crystal Springs Resort, every moment felt like a page from a modern fairytale filled with laughter, color, and heartfelt emotion. From intimate family ceremonies to energetic dance floors, their celebration was a joyful journey of love captured to perfection. The festivities began on Friday w

Later that evening, they gathered their closest friends and family for a warm and lively Mehndi celebration, complete with games that brought everyone’s competitive side to life. Saturday brought the kind of energy that defines South Asian celebrations—a Sangeet to remember. Held at the Diamond Ballroom, Minerals Hotel, Crystal Springs Resort , the night featured an incredible lineup of thirteen performances that kept the crowd on their feet. Nisha & Rohan surprised each other with solo dances that stole the show—her dazzling performance to “Sharara” and his nostalgic rendition of “Ek Pal Ka Jeena”, complete with the iconic Hrithik moves. They closed out the performances with a hig

Sunday morning came early, but the excitement never waned. After heartfelt Getting Ready moments and an intimate First Look at the Quarry, the couple exchanged personal vows in a private setting—shedding a few tears and plenty of smiles. Rohan then made a grand Baraat entrance in his striking red Corvette, dancing his way to the ceremony with infectious joy. At the Baraat Gate , Nisha’s parents and family welcomed him with open hearts and blessings. Then came one of the most emotional moments of the weekend: Nisha’s entrance into the Wedding Garden at Grand Cascades Lodge . Draped in a stunning maroon and gold leheng

The ceremony, designed with timeless beauty by Exclusive Events , was a scene of elegance and emotion. As if scripted by the heavens, the sun broke through the clouds just as the couple began their pheras , bathing the ceremony in golden light. Their emotional vidai followed soon after, with Nisha & Rohan driving off in the same red Corvette that had marked his Baraat entrance—a perfect poetic full circle. Just when guests thought the weekend couldn’t possibly get more magical, the couple’s dazzling reception at the Big Sky Pavilion began. Their first dance—an elegant mix of “I Like Me Better” and “Suraj Hua Maddham”—featured dramatic lifts and romantic dips th

Moghul Caterers delighted guests with a menu bursting with flavor and tradition, while Cafe Pierrot created a cake as beautiful as it was delicious. DJ Ohm and Atish Kirpalani elevated every event with music that kept hearts racing and feet moving all night long. From henna artistry by Hiral Vyas to the chic stationery by Minted , every vendor played a part in creating a seamless, unforgettable experience. But perhaps what truly made this wedding unforgettable was the way it was captured. Saroj Studios , with their cinematic finesse and eye for emotion, documented the day with breathtaking artistry. Their cinematography doesn’t just show what the w
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | edding looked like—they make you feel it. Every laugh, every tear, and every sparkle reflected the essence of what Maharani Weddings celebrates—love in all its vibrant, beautiful forms. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? Rohan and I are college sweethearts. We met through a mutual friend, and our first date was one evening at Starbucks on campus. We ended up talking for so long that Starbucks kicked us out at closing! I knew he was “the one” when I realized I was scared at the thought of losing him and could not picture my life and future without him. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! In March 2024, we took a little getaway trip to Cancún, where Rohan proposed two days before my birthday. Rohan told me we were going to a yacht party as an excuse for m
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | e to get dressed up, and it worked! It was quite a long journey to get to the proposal spot, including two taxi rides and a ferry, but it was worth it because Rohan really found a hidden jewel in La Isla Mujeres. He proposed at a beautiful cliffside where no one else was present but the two of us. Rohan had arranged for an incredible photo shoot with a local photographer, which then followed and was very memorable and fun. It rained on and off that day, so we were initially disappointed, but some say rain is good luck, so we decided to make the most of it, and our photos turned out amazing regardless. We came back to our hotel, and Rohan had secretly arranged for our room to be beautifully decorated with roses, balloons, champagne, chocolate, and a “Marry Me” sign. It all felt like a dream
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ! How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? My favorite color is pink, so I was initially set on wearing a pink bridal lehenga for the wedding ceremony. I tried many pink lehengas, in all shades of pink, but I was not really sold on any particular one. One day, disappointed in the ceremony lehenga search, I decided to change direction and start looking for a Sangeet lehenga, and my eyes were immediately drawn to this dark red/maroon and gold sparkling lehenga. It was stunning. I tried it on and instantly knew it was “the one” for the wedding ceremony. My husband, fiancé at the time, and our immediate family all loved the lehenga as well, so I bought it that day, which was very unusual for me, as I was typically indecisive when it came to
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | finalizing wedding lehengas. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? In addition to not hiring a wedding planner, we also undertook other wedding vendor roles. With my dance background, I decided to choreograph all the wedding dances from Sangeet to Reception, and Rohan, with his tech background, became our personal DJ and mixed all our wedding music from dances to entrances and more. I personally loved choosing the dance songs with Rohan and choreographing each of them uniquely based on who was performing. The dances were such an integral part of our wedding, so we are really glad we made the decision to make them our own from start to finish. It was also really fun teaching Rohan the choreography for our 3 dances and practicing together for hours on end in his
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | apartment; it was an atypical but regular date night. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? Many of our guests were very kind and complimentary, noting our wedding was straight out of a Bollywood movie! The music, dances, energy, and hype that Rohan and I brought to each wedding event and each dance really resonated with all our guests, and that’s what they remember most. This means a lot to us because we really put a lot of time and effort into all of our dances and music, and ultimately, we wanted to ensure that our guests had a great time! Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? One particularly special moment that constantly replays in our mind was performing our Bride & Groom dance at the Sangeet. It was the last da
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | nce of the performance portion of the evening, dance 13. At that point in the evening, we were both exhausted having performed so many dances as well as solos, but we could not wait to perform our first official dance as Bride & Groom! Over our wedding weekend, Rohan and I performed a total of 3 dances as a couple, of which the Sangeet dance felt the most special and fun because it included all our favorite Bollywood songs like “Akhiyaan Gulab,” “Chaleya,” and “Thug Le,” and was the most upbeat and energetic dance. As mentioned in response to a different question, when our guests saw us dance, they felt like they were transported to a Bollywood movie, and that attests to how much energy and spirit we brought to our dances. This was the first time our guests saw us dance together, and it wa
