COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Franklin, NJ Indian Wedding by Manish and Sung Photography September 23, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments From the moment Aditi & Ankit’s eyes met across a crowded room, it was clear their story would be one worth telling. Their wedding was a dazzling showcase of tradition and creativity that made everyone reach for their phones (and tissues). The spiritual union took place at the majestic BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir . With its intricately carved pillars and serene white marble, this venue set the tone for an unforgettable ceremony
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | steeped in heritage. Enter Royal Vivaah Creations , whose floral artistry elevated the mandir’s beauty into a dreamy canvas of color. Aditi was a vision, with hair and makeup by Shiza Ahmed , who ensured her glow matched the sparkle in her eyes. From pre-wedding glam to the final dance, every look was on point. Henna queen Henna by Ash-Ashlesha Parekh added intricate artistry to the bride’s hands, each swirl and motif a love story of its own. Meanwhile, behind the lens, Manish and Sung Photography worked their magic, capturing every glance, gesture, and stolen smile. Their storytelling style gave each image a sense of intimacy and energy—whether it was the sacred ceremony or the glamour of the reception at The Marigold , a venue that defines elegance. No Indian wedding is complete without
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | a soundtrack, and here’s where Kurani Studios came in—not once, not twice, but thrice! Handling DJ, baraat, and even the photo booth, they kept spirits high and energy higher. Their reputation for keeping the dance floor alive is legendary, and they didn’t disappoint. (Seriously, if you weren’t dancing, were you even at the wedding?) The couple treated guests to a feast by Moghul Caterers , whose flavorful creations had everyone lining up for seconds (and thirds—no judgment here). For sweet endings, Whole Foods Market provided the wedding cake, joined by guest cakes from La Bon Bake Shoppes and the delightful treats of Nothing Bundt Cakes . Let’s just say dessert was not an afterthought—it was a full-blown experience. Even the smallest details spoke volumes: custom cake toppers from Etsy
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | artists, styling touches from Dreams Decor , and hair color finesse by Cece MacNeill . Every vendor brought something special, each playing a part in weaving this unforgettable tapestry of love. Looking back, Aditi & Ankit’s day wasn’t just about rituals or aesthetics—it was about celebrating family, faith, and the undeniable joy of finding “the one.” It was big, bold, and brimming with beauty, just like the couple themselves. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? I knew Ankit was the one when my (now our) dog, Howie, got violently sick in the car and he helped me get to the vet, clean out the car, and spent the day with me to help me keep me sane until I heard back. Ankit and I met on Hinge, and I decided to head off on a 2-week cruise with friends, fully ant
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | icipating our conversation to fizzle out as I country hopped. However, every time I got service at a port of call, there would be a random Beyonce meme waiting for my reaction. Even if I wasn't able to respond for a day or two, or if my responses were short-- he would, without fail, send me something every day. We decided to meet up once I got back, but that would be also be pushed as I ended up with COVID. Although he messaged first, I suggested meeting up for a Trivia Date once I was better, which ended up being about 6 weeks after we first started talking. I was nervous to transition to real life as that's when things fizzle, but meeting Ankit for the first time was like being swept up in a wave of calm. From the onset, he was the quiet to my chaos, the stillness to my storm. I knew I h
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ad found something special when we were no longer able paying attention to trivia because we were talking to each other. Fast forward through a few more dates, Howie decided to put his future Dad to the test by vomiting all over the car, repeatedly. Ankit handled both of us as calmly and gently as possible, and I knew that if there was ever a future with a family for me, it would be with Ankit. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Ankit's original plan was proposing on Mt. Vesuvius, as I had tried (and almost succeeded) to convince him that Mt. Vesuvius was in Greece. I promptly threw a wrench in as I did not want to be proposed to on vacation. He rallied and orchestrated an even more personal and meaningful proposal at Duke Gardens. Ankit rushed me home after a week-long trip to Vermon
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | t and Canada under the guise of meeting some of his friends for their wedding planning. We were supposed to have dinner with them at Duke Gardens, and I was irate. Who in their right mind would say yes to dinner after a 10-hour car ride home from Canada?! I was cranky-- I didn't want to shave my legs, wear a dress, do my makeup. I wanted to curl up on the couch and snuggle with him and our pup. He got me to Duke Gardens, and we took a walk to the Orchid House. I had never been, so while I was geeking out at all of the varieties of flowers, we was setting up to take some pictures before heading to dinner. It was in the orchid greenhouse, surrounded by lush plants and beautiful flowers that he asked me if I would like to spend the rest of our lives together. Tell us how you went about planni
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ng your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. Family is of the utmost importance to both us, and our families wanted to share this with our nearest and dearest. Ankit and I wanted to ensure that we kept close to tradition and prioritized simplicity. Planning a wedding is hard. It's also usually the first group project you do with your parents. Between managing personalities, competing preferences, wants, budgeting, etc, it get's emotional and dicey pretty quickly. Ankit did a lot of the stakeholder management, and I did a lot of the logistics and execution. Our original plan was to have a small, intimate temple ceremony with immediate family and a large reception, but it was cost prohibitive, so we
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ended up doing a large ceremony with a slightly smaller reception in the evening. We knew from the start that we wanted a temple wedding. We wanted a place that was already steeped in the ambiance and virture of tradition, so we decided on BAPS Edison. Our AM decorator was Dreams Decor who did an amazing job with the Rose Gold and Maroon steeped mandap and backdrop. We had about 300 attendees, catering was done by BAPs. Our evening reception was at The Marigold in Somerset, with a Rajasthani Royalty theme. We had Moghul catering, Kurani Studios for entertainment. Wedding Art NJ decorated our event, and we had some personal touches scattered throughout-- our dogs were our cake toppers, we made personalized table tents for each tables, personalized chocolates, and our returns were our favor
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ite Bundtinis. Hair and Makeup for both events were done by Shiza Ahmed; Photo and Video were done by Manish & Sung. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? My vision was ivory, but we compromised on burgundy. We had started looking at lenghas, and nothing was clicking for me. Finally, we walked into Meghna Jain Modish, and I found an ivory lengha I just couldn't stop looking at. She pushed me to try it on despite us looking at bridal wear, and once I put it on, I knew it was the one. I had to call Ankit and show him, and he agreed-- it was perfect. It fit our simple and traditional vibe perfectly. We had a similar experience with my reception lengha-- we just walked into a store and it was there. What was the most enjoyable part of th
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | e planning process, and why? Ankit and I did a 'last dance' to cap our reception. We were surrounded by our closest friends and got to dance to our song as our friends lit up the dance floor with their phone lights. It felt like we were dancing among the stars. This also signaled the end to an event we had been putting together for over a year, and it felt right that we got to share it together, just the two of us. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? We still get compliments about our wedding-- it was simple, traditional, and steeped in love. Our entertainment team from Kurani Studios was amazing. They kept everyone on the dance floor the entire night, just like we asked, and some of our friends have also reached out to them for their events. Our guests also loved ou
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | r Bundtini return favors-- it was a sweet little treat to cap off a night of partying! Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? We abandoned tradition as my sisters walked me down the aisle to the mandap for me to start the next phase of my life. We did this as a symbol that while Ankit may be marrying me, his responsibility to protect, nurture, and love extends to my sisters as well. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? You're not going to remember the small things, so don't hyperfocus on them. Something will go wrong, just focus on enjoying your day and letting go of control. Anything else you want to tell us?

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Farmington Hills, MI Indian Wedding by 97 Films September 19, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments When it comes to South Asian weddings, words like “grand” and “lavish” sometimes feel like understatements. This wedding, however, redefined what it means to celebrate love in technicolor style—with thoughtful planning, dazzling décor, and cinematography that makes you feel like you’re sitting front row at a blockbuster premiere. Marigold Wedding Planners brought the couple’s dream to life, blending artistry and precision in equal measure . From start to finish, every detail was planned with the kind of care that only seasoned pros can deliver. Guest experience was top of mind—no detail too sm
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | all, no floral garland too delicate. And speaking of florals, their designs transformed every venue into a fragrant fairytale. Imagine mandaps that seemed to float on blooms, tablescapes that whispered romance, and entrances that felt like stepping into another world. Marigold didn’t just decorate; they orchestrated an atmosphere. The festivities kicked off at Farmington Hills Manor , where the sangeet sparkled with vibrant energy and dancing that could rival a Bollywood stage. The vows were exchanged at the elegant Wabeek Country Club , where lush greenery created a natural frame for the sacred rituals. To cap it all off, the Meridian Banquet & Conference Center hosted a reception so glamorous that chandeliers and couture outfits were practically in competition for the spotlight. Here’s w
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | here the magic hit another level. 97 Films captured every glance, every laugh, every twirl of the lehenga with cinematic finesse. Their work doesn’t just document moments—it turns them into timeless art. Watching the wedding film feels like being whisked back into the celebration: the music swelling at just the right second, the slow-motion baraat entrance (yes, goosebumps included), and the way the couple’s chemistry lights up the screen. If wedding films had Oscars, this one would have at least three. Rosy & Shaun Wedding Photography ensured no emotion went unnoticed, snapping portraits that could double as cover art for a romance novel. Magda Violin Rocks elevated the ceremony with melodies that tugged at heartstrings, while Sugar Events & Entertainment kept the dance floor alive well i
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | nto the night. Add in JHobby Makeup Studio’s glam touch, Arnold Cakes’ sweet confections, and the artistry of Pavi Henna Art , and you’ve got a wedding that checks every “wow” box imaginable. The flavors of the celebration came courtesy of Raj Palace Catering , a spread so indulgent that guests were probably plotting second (and third) helpings before the first course was finished. From appetizers to desserts, it was the kind of menu that lingers in memory long after the last toast. This wedding wasn’t just an event—it was an experience, layered with tradition, artistry, and joy . A big shout-out to the vendors whose talent turned love into magic. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? It was modern dating with a twist! We met on good old Dil Mil, but had a few
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | common friends who vetted for each other. The first message Manuj sent to me was "Punjabi, loves dogs/Mexican food, and enjoys the beach, check to all of that, when can the dholi come?" It was love at first text, and we knew how special it was that we connected. We spent the first year of dating long-distance, and eagerly waited to see one another every few weeks. They say you cannot take the Texas out of a man (and this is true!), but I took the man out of Texas! Manuj moved to Michigan for us, and our relationship flourished. I knew he was the one from all the compromises, unselfish love, and commitment he made. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? I think the absolute best part of our wedding that our guests and we loved was having our dog, Zen, be a part of our H
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | aldi ceremony. Zen is the light of our life, and it was imperative he had a role in our wedding events. We were so touched that all our guests enjoyed his sweet company. He brought his good energy to our Haldi, and it is a forever memory! Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? Reading our vows aloud at the Hindu ceremony was the most special and loving moment. It was something we always wanted to do, and we're so happy to have that core memory. Our vows were vulnerable, raw, and we deeply expressed our profound love to each other.

Natasha & Alain's multi-day affair was a symphony of culture, style, and heart—set against venues that were as memorable as the couple themselves. From a garba night that sparkled with color to a ceremony filled with reverence and a reception dripping in glamour, this wedding had it all. The festivities began at Akbar Restaurant , where Natasha & Alain hosted their lively sangeet. With bright hues, playful décor, and a night full of music and dance, the celeb

When it came time to exchange vows, the timeless charm of Christ United Methodist Church set the stage for a heartfelt ceremony. Natasha glided down the aisle in elegance, her look perfected by Glam by Rabs , who transformed her into a vision of grace with flawless hair and makeup. The floral artistry of Mandap Milap brought softness and romance to the church, ensuring every corner whispered love. But the magic didn’t stop there. The couple’s grand reception at Royal Albert’s Palace was nothing short of regal. Imagine shimmering chandeliers, dazzling décor, and an atmosphere that felt both intimate and spectacular.

The heartbeat of the celebration, however, pulsed thanks to Kurani Studios . More than just a DJ, they orchestrated the soundtrack to Natasha and Alain’s love story. Their team didn’t just play music—they created an experience. From the electrifying baraat, where Kurani Studios set the tone with beats that had everyone dancing in the streets, to the reception where the lighting design transformed the ballroom into a glowing wonderland, their touch elevated the celebration from memorable to unforgettable. Guests snapped endless memories at the Kurani Studios photo booth, keeping the energy alive long after the last song. It was a masterclass in how one vendor’s versatility can impact

From Natasha’s mehndi by Alfaaz , etched with intricate detail, to the grand finale, this wedding was a journey—one filled with laughter, tradition, and the kind of energy that makes you wish you could hit rewind and live it all over again.
