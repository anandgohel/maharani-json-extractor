Baltimore, MD Indian Wedding by Nayeem Vohra Photography November 21, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments When it comes to love stories that blend elegance, emotion, and a touch of sparkle, Shikha & Vipul’s Baltimore wedding was pure perfection. Think panoramic waterfront views, five-star flair, and a celebration so artfully curated it could double as a masterclass in modern Indian luxury. Their love story began with a match on Coffee Meets Bagel —a digital twist on the classic “boy meets girl.” Their journey to “I do” unfolded over an unforgettable weekend that reflected both grandeur and heart. The fe
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | stivities kicked off with a vibrant sangeet at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront , where the air buzzed with dhol beats, laughter, and choreographed joy. Shikha choreographed most of the evening and performed in nearly half the dances herself—her energy lighting up the stage. Events By Vaishali , the creative force behind the wedding’s seamless flow, transformed every space into a reflection of elegance and celebration. The décor by Partyland Sajawat was a feast for the senses. Sachi didn’t just bring a vision to life—she turned Pinterest dreams into an experience even more breathtaking than imagined. When the big day arrived, the Four Seasons Hotel Baltimore became the stage for Shikha & Vipul’s stunning ceremony overlooking the harbor, with sunlight streaming in like a divine blessing. S

Her bridal glow was perfected by Style by Susmita , whose calm, artistic touch made every moment effortlessly elegant. From her intricate Om Sons Bridal Store jewelry to her serene smile, every detail spoke of joy and confidence. Vipul’s grand baraat—led by Premier Entertainment —was pure celebration. His procession danced its way from the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront to the Four Seasons, framed by the sparkling Inner Harbor. In a special twist, Shikha made a surprise cameo from a terrace overlooking the lively crowd, a cinematic prelude to their vows. Their ceremony music by Pavan Verma added a soulful layer to the moment. He played “Madhanya” on the flute as Shikha made her entrance, filling
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | the air with emotion. The ceremony itself was filled with laughter, reverence, and the kind of heartfelt glances that make time stand still. The ballroom shimmered under chandeliers, with a custom dance floor by GoToShout setting the stage for nonstop revelry. Premier Entertainment once again kept the energy alive, ensuring guests danced until the very last beat. Culinary perfection came courtesy of Moghul Catering , who honored both Punjabi and Telugu traditions with exquisite dishes that had guests raving long after the weekend ended. But what truly set this wedding apart was its warmth. Despite the grandeur, every moment felt deeply personal—woven together with family, intention, and love. Shikha credits her parents for being her ultimate teammates: her mother’s calm wisdom and her fat
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | her’s logistical brilliance turned planning into a family art form. From late-night checklist sessions to “Tetris-packing” a moving truck, every bit of this wedding was built with heart. And of course, every stunning second was immortalized by Nayeem Vohra Photography , whose artistry turned fleeting emotions into timeless treasures. From Bhavna’s Henna -adorned hands to every dance floor spin, their lens captured the soul of the celebration. From heartfelt vows to sangeet sparkle, this Baltimore wedding was more than an event—it was a celebration of two souls intertwining, a masterclass in blending North and South Indian cultures with style, substance, and sincerity. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? We met the good old-fashioned way...reaching for the sa
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | me jalapeno in a grocery store.. Just kidding, we met on a dating app called Coffee Meets Bagel! After we matched, instead of small talk about the weather & our favorite colors, he immediately messaged asking to meet in person at a really cute cocktail bar in Philly called One Tippling Place. Our first date had some eavesdroppers who were sitting next to us & when he went to the restroom, they tapped me on the shoulder and were shocked that we were only on a first date! Even though it was a "school night," we closed the bar down & the rest was history. Even though I'll never admit it to him, I knew he was the one pretty early on. I was in my GI fellowship at the time which can be really demanding, and he was endlessly supportive. From the start, we dated with intention. Every conversation,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | including the serious ones, only brought us closer. Nothing scared him off & if anything, it made us both even more excited for what was to come! Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. We actually started planning our wedding before we were even engaged! Having attended so many weddings together, we quickly became experts in what worked (and what we’d do differently). Through those experiences, we organically discovered many of our own vendors. We started a little backward by hunting for venues first. After touring multiple options, we ultimately chose a beautiful location at the Inner Harbor in Baltimore - perfectly situated between both sides of our famili
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | es. Our vision was for everyone to move into the hotel for the entire weekend so that it felt like one big family reunion rather than a series of separate events. We did everything but the wedding ceremony at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, which is where all our guests were staying. The baraat was super fun since it walked my husband's side from the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, where they were staying, to the wedding venue at the Four Seasons with the backdrop of the Inner Harbor! I even got to pop out of one of the Four Seasons' terraces that overlooked the baraat walk for a quick cameo!! By the time we found our wedding planner - Events By Vaishali, we already had the venue booked - but she was truly our saving grace. Her team coordinated every vendor, handled all the moving parts,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | and, most importantly, ensured the weekend ran seamlessly. I was able to completely hand over my stress (and my phone!) to them and just be present during the weekend. It wasn’t until after the weekend that I learned about all the little fires they’d quietly put out behind the scenes like true professionals. Our planner also introduced me to my makeup artist, Style By Susmita, with whom I connected instantly. She has such a gift for enhancing your natural beauty and creating a calm, grounded energy - which is so important, especially since you spend more time with your hair and makeup team than almost anyone else during the wedding weekend! My planner also introduced me to my mehndi artist, who was equally incredible. We did a long Zoom consultation where she designed my patterns on an iP
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ad. She spent over nine hours doing my full bridal mehndi but kept up the most positive, warm energy the entire time - it felt more like spending the day with a close friend than with a vendor. Our decorator, Sachi from PartylandSajawa, turned from vendor to fast friend. She completely understood our vision and brought it to life with such attention to detail. Each event felt so distinct yet cohesive. She had this rare ability to take my Pinterest dreams and translate them into something even more beautiful than I imagined. Our photographer was Nayeem Vohra, whom I met at my best friend's wedding over 5 years ago. I knew from that moment that he was going to be my photographer before I even had a man or a date selected. The universe was in my favor that he happened to be free! His team has
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | an incredible way of making you feel comfortable in front of the camera, and he always gets the best shot! Our caterer was Mogul Catering, which was out of this world! I am Punjabi, and my husband is Telugu so it was important for us to both have our cultures represented. During our tasting, Mogul made sure to have us try special dishes from both parts of India and absolutely came through during our weekend. Our guests could not stop raving about it!! As a dancer, our musical talent was of the utmost importance. We used Premier DJs, HR Beats, and Ambition. They knew the vibe we needed for all four events, and we didn't have a single repeated song all weekend! Our planner also recommended Pawan Varma, who is a flautist & saxophonist. He brought such a unique energy to our baraat, wedding &
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | reception. He played "Madhanya" on his flute for my bridal entrance and played saxophone covers of all our favorite Bollywood songs during the baraat & cocktail hour! The outfit process was a whirlwind! We traveled to India for just a few days, so I had to make every minute count. I had done tons of research beforehand, but between choosing my own looks and helping my sister find hers, it was an adventure. Susmita, my makeup artist, was incredibly helpful even from afar, guiding me to pick outfits that complemented one another while still being unique for each event. Special shout-out to both my parents who never left my side during the shopping marathon. We also got a chance to custom make our bridal party outfits with Meetu Makkad in Shahpur Jat, which was such a cool & unique process!
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | And finally, the heart of it all, my family. My mom was my rock throughout the entire planning process. Together, we mastered the Notes app like pros, creating shared to-do lists and weekly check-ins with every detail meticulously tracked. My mom had this magical way of balancing logistics and emotions - she kept us organized, grounded and laughing through it all. Every little moment of our wedding had its fingerprints on it, from the tiniest décor details to the thoughtful guest experiences. My dad was instrumental in execution, helping us expertly pack inventory into bins in the months leading up to everything, and Tetris packing a huge moving truck without missing a single piece. It truly became a family project filled with so much love, teamwork, and joy. What was the most enjoyable pa
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | rt of the planning process, and why? The best part of the planning process was doing it together. We only had 6 months from our proposal to our wedding day, but we got through it all together! Things can definitely get stressful at times since there are so many moving parts but having each other through it all made it feel fun and meaningful. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? The wedding weekend goes by in a complete blur - everyone tells you that, but you don’t really believe it until you’re in it. For me, the one moment that felt like time actually stopped was in between our wedding ceremony and reception. Vipul and I had about an hour completely to ourselves, and it was the first time all weekend that things felt quiet. We just sat t
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ogether, taking it all in - everything we’d planned, everyone we loved, and the fact that we were finally married. It reminded me that all of it, the planning, the details, the celebration,s was ultimately for these moments together. Overall, the entire weekend was a special moment. Flashbacks of all our family & friends having the time of their life on the dance floor and eating biriyani & gol gappe will live in my heart forever! Weaving both the North & South Indian cultures was also really special! For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. As a lifelong dancer, the Sangeet was especially close to my heart. I choreographed almost the entire evening and somehow still found myself performing in
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | nearly half the dances! It was one of the most fun parts of the whole wedding weekend. Seeing our family and friends pour so much love, energy, and enthusiasm into every performance was incredibly special.

Sakina & Joshua’s wedding
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | was one of those rare tales that beautifully bridged two worlds, blending Muslim and Catholic traditions into one breathtaking celebration of love, respect, and unity. Every moment was a testament to how two souls—and two faiths—can come together to create something truly extraordinary. The festivities began with a lively mehndi at Canto Restaurant and Banquet , where vibrant hues, laughter, and rhythmic beats set the tone for the days ahead. Sakina’s hands and heart were adorned with intricate henna by talented artists as friends and family gathered to celebrate the start of something unforgettable. The air was alive with warmth, conversation, and the delicious aroma of Indian delicacies—a prelude to the joy that would unfold over the next few days. Then came the sacred ceremonies—each ho

The Catholic vows took place at the serene St. Peter’s Church, where sunlight poured through stained glass as Joshua watched his bride walk down the aisle in an exquisite Aisha Rao creation that looked straight out of a dream. Later, a second ceremony at Fairfield by Marriott honored Sakina’s Muslim faith with the same reverence and beauty. Together, these moments reflected not just a union of hearts but of beliefs, families, and traditions—woven seamlessly into one harmonious story of love. Their celebrations continued with a chic gathering at The Bombay Club , an elegant venue that echoed timeless sophistication.

Set against the stunning turquoise waters of Royalton Splash Riviera Cancun , this fusion of Indian elegance and Caribbean charm was magical. Gopi and Nick's love story began at a tennis social at their gym. Gopi, a lifelong tennis player, instantly connected with Nick, a newcomer to the sport. After playing, they went to dinner and quickly became engrossed in conversation, talking nonstop. Gopi chose a Florida birthday celebration in 20
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | 24, bringing both families together for a memorable getaway. After a fun-filled day, Nick privately proposed with an engagement ring. They then woke the whole house to celebrate together. Once they chose a destination wedding, Gopi went deep into blogs, Pinterest boards, and Instagram—where she kept seeing Indian Destination Wedding, Inc. pop up. A call with Ateet was all it took. Venue selection became a breeze, and suddenly, planning felt exciting rather than overwhelming. They also ensured seamless travel logistics. Guests raved about how easy and stress-free the arrangements were—something Gopi deeply valued. Through Indian Destination Wedding , they were introduced to their dream planners, Shahira and Edith of Pyaar Planning , who helped shape the vision Gopi didn’t even know she had.
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Instead of obsessing over décor, Gopi focused on what mattered most—guest experience and staying on budget. Zuniga and Tulipania Floral & Decor transformed every corner into a blooming paradise. Soft draping, vivid florals, and intimate candlelight created that perfect balance of island romance and Indian opulence. The Royalton’s team delivered flawless service and indulgent catering—complete with irresistible samosas that no one had the willpower to refuse. Having an Indian restaurant and chef on-site made the culinary experience seamless and deeply authentic. Styled by the incomparable Alex Corbanezi , Gopi radiated effortless glam. Her bridal ensemble , fro m Sahil Exclusive and Paaneri India , sparkled with intricate work that shimmered under the Caribbean sun. Her bridal lehenga was
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | particularly meaningful: a traditional Gujarati panetar chosen lovingly by her parents , revealed to her only the day before in honor of cultural tradition. For the sangeet, she rocked a hot pink lightweight outfit perfect for dancing, selected in under an hour without even trying it on. Her reception look—a stunning custom royal blue ensemble—was bold, regal, and unforgettable. Nick, complementing her effortlessly, wore a tailored pistachio green look from SuitShop that matched the tropical setting perfectly . If there’s one thing Nick promised, it was that they would have fun —and he delivered. Staying at a resort with a full water park, he made it mandatory that they ride a water slide every day of the wedding. Even Gopi’s meticulous planning couldn’t stand a chance against his spontane
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ity. One of the most memorable moments? Rain during their rooftop sangeet. Guests were ushered into a smaller covered area, mingling until the skies cleared. As soon as the music resumed, a guest slid across the wet dance floor like a human slip-n-slide—breaking the tension and sparking pure joy on the dance floor. Between Bollywood choreography by Meher Dance , a sangeet hosted by Gopi’s talented brother, and inclusive dance lessons that had everyone grooving—even Nick’s side, attending their first Indian wedding—it became a beautiful blend of families, traditions, and pure celebration. From the dhol beats that fired up the baraat to DJ Samuel Ortiz’s electrifying mixes, the energy never dipped for a moment. MC Israel Rocha kept guests engaged and dancing nonstop. Mills James handled ligh

Every breathtaking moment was captured by Gareth Davies Photography , whose eye for emotion brought the entire story to life. Asha Films added the perfect cinematic touch. And Loto Mehndi adorned Gopi with delicate, meaningful designs that honored tradition and added one last touch of artistry. From heartfelt laughter to ocean views, from cultural traditions to slides at the waterpark, Gopi & Nick’s wedding was more than a celebration—it was a radiant fusion of two families, two cultures, and two souls choosing joy at every step How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? We met at a tennis social at our gym. I’ve been playing tennis since I was 3, and Nick started playing
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | a few years ago. After the tennis part, the whole group grabbed dinner together, where we started talking across the table and never stopped. I knew Nick was the one when I saw how much he loves his family. We both are very close to our families and seeing Nick light up when his parents are around is so heartwarming. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! For my birthday in 2024, I wanted to celebrate in Florida with my family. Since it was summer, we decided to make a big family trip out of it, where Nick’s immediate family flew down, as did my brother, Jigar, and his family. We spent my birthday celebrating all day and ended the night with a big family game night (our favorite!). Right before going to bed, Nick pulled out my last gift (my engagement ring) and proposed in private. We the

Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. Once we decided to have a destination wedding, I started reviewing all the blogs and Instagram accounts I could find of couples who had done the same, and kept seeing Indian Destination Wedding listed as a vendor. I reached out to them, and I am so glad I did. From our first conversation with Ateet, we felt more at ease and very excited to plan our event. He made the venue selection project such a breeze by reviewing our wishlist and providing options for which venues could accommodate. Through Ateet and the Indian Destination Wedding team, we were connected with Shahira and Edith from Py
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | aar Planning, who were also essential to our wedding planning team. I wasn't one of those girls who had a vision board for her wedding, so they had to help me define what I wanted. For me, budget and guest experience were more important than decor, so we focused on those things. I relied on my planners to help narrow the list of potential vendors so I only had to choose from a few. I highly suggest letting go of some control and letting your planners help. I leaned on Edith and Shato to tell me which vendors they know and work with because having a cohesive vendor team made things so much easier. One thing I learned is that the resort event planners are also involved in this process, and some communication with them is redundant, so my advice to other brides is to loop them in early so you
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | don't have to repeat conversations about planning. Lastly, I must mention that I delegated some vendor tasks to my family. My brother loves all things music, and since I knew he would have the most opinions, I let him lead the process of selecting the DJ/MC team and preparing this team for the wedding. My sister-in-law has a great eye for detail, so I asked for her help in reviewing makeup artists and photographers. Both my brother and sister-in-law had great ideas and did a fantastic job. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I wore a traditional Gujarati panetar, so I actually didn't pick it. I told my parents I wanted a whiter white (rather than cream) with embroidery/work which would match my mom's wedding jewelry because I knew
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | I wanted to wear that. Our cultural tradition is that the wedding dress is hidden from the bride until the day before the wedding, when I do a ceremony (blindfolded) after which my outfit is revealed. Although I do like to control in all aspects of my life, not having to pick this was a gift. My parents were so joyful in their search and in how hard they worked to hide the outfit from me so I wouldn't accidentally see it. I did pick my sangeet and reception outfits, which we did in one hour. I loved working with Sahil Chicago - I highly recommend them. I knew I wanted a hot pink outfit I could dance in for the Sangeet, and finalized this outfit without trying it on. It was lightweight, soft, and still beautiful. Nick loves light green, and so we chose a pistachio outfit (which was on disp
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | lay) for him, and it worked beautifully. For my reception outfit, I saw this outfit in a mint color on the mannequin in the store. I asked if I could customize the color, and I was given a book of threads to pick from. I knew I wanted a royal blue outfit, and that was it. I ordered both outfits in October, and they were delivered by January. The Saahil team recommended coming back in around early June for a final fitting and did a few blouse alterations within 2 weeks, so I had the outfits ready one month before the wedding. For our bridal party outfits, we had a great experience with Kaajal at Sari Sapne in Chicago. I asked to see outfits within my budget and saw a red anarkali outfit in the store, which I liked. I customized the outfit to look like a mix of the sky and ocean since the we

What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? I loved my meetings with my planners to finalize details. I appreciated the time and effort they put in ahead of time to narrow options/choices so I could just choose. There were some details/signs that I wanted to make, and I liked using my creativity to draw/design them and giving it to my decor team to implement. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? The Indian Destination Wedding team made the travel arrangements a breeze, which many guests raved about. Alyssa was so responsive and patient with many questions, and travel/logistics were seamless. I did elec
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | tronic invitations. which was a big concern initially; however, almost all of the guests were able to manage the invites. I did have to reach out to some folks to check their spam box, but that was much easier than waiting for RSVPs in the mail. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? I am the organized one, and Nick is the fun one. He made it his mission for us to have fun at our wedding. Our resort had a water park, and Nick mandated that we ride a water slide every day of our wedding events. I had so many things I wanted to do, but he put his foot down and forced us to run away for a few minutes to have childish fun. Another one of my favorite moments was all about reframing. It started raining during our Sangeet, which was on a beautiful
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | rooftop terrace. All of the guests were ushered into a smaller covered area for a few minutes to wait out the rain, and started mingling together. Once the rain stopped, the dance floor was wet, and I wasn't sure how the rest of the night would unfold. The music started, and one of our guests ran over and slid across the dance floor on his belly like a "slip-n-slide". This broke the tension, and all of the guests quickly jumped on the dance floor without any separation of whose "side" they were from. For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. The dances at the Sangeet were phenomenal. We had the team from Meher Dance in Chicago for choreography, and they were fantastic to work with. Gopi was kin
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | d, patient, and so enthusiastic about the whole process. I loved seeing everyone dance and enjoy themselves - especially Nick's family, who jumped into Bollywood choreography and nailed it. My brother, Jigar, was the emcee for the Sangeet and did a great job of welcoming guests, energizing the crowd, and incorporating Nick's family into indian wedding traditions. He even led an "intro to indian dancing" to teach some basic moves so everyone felt comfortable with the music and felt invited to join in. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? 1. Don't be scared to talk about money. It feels uncomfortable, but it's so easy for the budget to balloon, and you're paying way more than anticipated. A thousand here and a thousand there all add up at the end. Own your budget. 2. I strongly
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | advise electronic invitations. I love the look of traditional invitations, but it just didn't make sense financially or logistically. I created an invite online, which was beautiful, and I printed it to frame for myself and our families, but all other guests received electronic invitations. There were many fewer issues than I expected, and it made RSVPs so easy. This is one discussion I'm very glad I didn't cave on. 3. My brother said this, and as much as I hate giving him accolades, I have to. He told me, "Think about who will be on your dance floor at the end of the night and make sure to invite those people." The guest list was the hardest part of wedding planning and felt like an emotional negotiation for a few weeks. Along with maintaining relationships with your parents, you also hav
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | e to create and build your own. I'm thankful to have fantastic friends who weren't offended when I asked not to invite their children due to guest list constraints. I had given enough notice that they arranged for childcare to come. This wasn't an option for some, but they were all understanding. 4. HIRE EVERYBODY! There will always be people who say you don't need planners/coordinators/etc, but you do. We both work full-time and did not have the bandwidth to deal with all of the details. 5. Let your vendors do what they do. Communicate extensively about what you want and how much you are willing to pay; they will execute accordingly. 6. Take a deep breath and remember to have fun. As a bride, you have to be the one making a lot of decisions, and you are the default for communication. This
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | was especially the case for us because this was the first indian wedding for most of Nick's side, and he couldn't answer any questions. I am so thankful that Nick was adamant that we have fun and talk about things other than the wedding. He always seemed to make plans for us right after my meetings with the planners so I didn't get caught up in the minutia. Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) Loto Mehndi was great and easy to work with. The food at the resort was great. We wanted a resort with an indian restaurant and an indian chef on the property. They took our feedback from our tasting and implemented it perfectly. My parents were the best through this process. They kept asking if I was happy
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | with the choices I was making and why. It really forced me to reflect on my choices and be thoughtful with my decisions. I couldn’t ask for better support and love from anyone. Darlings, check our daily blogs for more inspiration and insider tips from our Platinum Guide pros.
