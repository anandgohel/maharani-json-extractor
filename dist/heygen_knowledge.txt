Hamburg, NJ Indian Wedding by Saroj Studios October 31, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments After over a year of planning, Nisha & Rohan’s dream wedding weekend finally arrived—and it was nothing short of spectacular. Hosted at the breathtaking Crystal Springs Resort, every moment felt like a page from a modern fairytale filled with laughter, color, and heartfelt emotion. From intimate family ceremonies to energetic dance floors, their celebration was a joyful journey of love captured to perfection. The festivities began on Friday with two intimate Graha Shanti ceremonies at home, setting a serene and auspicious tone for the weeke
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | nd ahead. Later that evening, they gathered their closest friends and family for a warm and lively Mehndi celebration, complete with games that brought everyone’s competitive side to life. Saturday brought the kind of energy that defines South Asian celebrations—a Sangeet to remember. Held at the Diamond Ballroom, Minerals Hotel, Crystal Springs Resort , the night featured an incredible lineup of thirteen performances that kept the crowd on their feet. Nisha & Rohan surprised each other with solo dances that stole the show—her dazzling performance to “Sharara” and his nostalgic rendition of “Ek Pal Ka Jeena”, complete with the iconic Hrithik moves. They closed out the performances with a high-energy medley of Bollywood hits, including “Chaleya,” “Akhiyaan Gulaab,” and “Thug Le,” before the
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | night turned into an all-out Garba, Dandiya, and dance floor extravaganza. Sunday morning came early, but the excitement never waned. After heartfelt Getting Ready moments and an intimate First Look at the Quarry, the couple exchanged personal vows in a private setting—shedding a few tears and plenty of smiles. Rohan then made a grand Baraat entrance in his striking red Corvette, dancing his way to the ceremony with infectious joy. At the Baraat Gate , Nisha’s parents and family welcomed him with open hearts and blessings. Then came one of the most emotional moments of the weekend: Nisha’s entrance into the Wedding Garden at Grand Cascades Lodge . Draped in a stunning maroon and gold lehenga, she walked under a matching chaddar carried lovingly by her four first cousins—a moment that drew
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | tears from everyone watching. The ceremony, designed with timeless beauty by Exclusive Events , was a scene of elegance and emotion. As if scripted by the heavens, the sun broke through the clouds just as the couple began their pheras , bathing the ceremony in golden light. Their emotional vidai followed soon after, with Nisha & Rohan driving off in the same red Corvette that had marked his Baraat entrance—a perfect poetic full circle. Just when guests thought the weekend couldn’t possibly get more magical, the couple’s dazzling reception at the Big Sky Pavilion began. Their first dance—an elegant mix of “I Like Me Better” and “Suraj Hua Maddham”—featured dramatic lifts and romantic dips that left guests mesmerized. Shiza Rizwan worked her magic in both hair and makeup as well as draping
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | and styling, ensuring Nisha looked radiant. Moghul Caterers delighted guests with a menu bursting with flavor and tradition, while Cafe Pierrot created a cake as beautiful as it was delicious. DJ Ohm and Atish Kirpalani elevated every event with music that kept hearts racing and feet moving all night long. From henna artistry by Hiral Vyas to the chic stationery by Minted , every vendor played a part in creating a seamless, unforgettable experience. But perhaps what truly made this wedding unforgettable was the way it was captured. Saroj Studios , with their cinematic finesse and eye for emotion, documented the day with breathtaking artistry. Their cinematography doesn’t just show what the wedding looked like—they make you feel it. Every laugh, every tear, and every sparkle reflected the e
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ssence of what Maharani Weddings celebrates—love in all its vibrant, beautiful forms. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? Rohan and I are college sweethearts. We met through a mutual friend, and our first date was one evening at Starbucks on campus. We ended up talking for so long that Starbucks kicked us out at closing! I knew he was “the one” when I realized I was scared at the thought of losing him and could not picture my life and future without him. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! In March 2024, we took a little getaway trip to Cancún, where Rohan proposed two days before my birthday. Rohan told me we were going to a yacht party as an excuse for me to get dressed up, and it worked! It was quite a long journey to get to the proposal spot, includi
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ng two taxi rides and a ferry, but it was worth it because Rohan really found a hidden jewel in La Isla Mujeres. He proposed at a beautiful cliffside where no one else was present but the two of us. Rohan had arranged for an incredible photo shoot with a local photographer, which then followed and was very memorable and fun. It rained on and off that day, so we were initially disappointed, but some say rain is good luck, so we decided to make the most of it, and our photos turned out amazing regardless. We came back to our hotel, and Rohan had secretly arranged for our room to be beautifully decorated with roses, balloons, champagne, chocolate, and a “Marry Me” sign. It all felt like a dream! How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? My
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | favorite color is pink, so I was initially set on wearing a pink bridal lehenga for the wedding ceremony. I tried many pink lehengas, in all shades of pink, but I was not really sold on any particular one. One day, disappointed in the ceremony lehenga search, I decided to change direction and start looking for a Sangeet lehenga, and my eyes were immediately drawn to this dark red/maroon and gold sparkling lehenga. It was stunning. I tried it on and instantly knew it was “the one” for the wedding ceremony. My husband, fiancé at the time, and our immediate family all loved the lehenga as well, so I bought it that day, which was very unusual for me, as I was typically indecisive when it came to finalizing wedding lehengas. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? In
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | addition to not hiring a wedding planner, we also undertook other wedding vendor roles. With my dance background, I decided to choreograph all the wedding dances from Sangeet to Reception, and Rohan, with his tech background, became our personal DJ and mixed all our wedding music from dances to entrances and more. I personally loved choosing the dance songs with Rohan and choreographing each of them uniquely based on who was performing. The dances were such an integral part of our wedding, so we are really glad we made the decision to make them our own from start to finish. It was also really fun teaching Rohan the choreography for our 3 dances and practicing together for hours on end in his apartment; it was an atypical but regular date night. What did your guests particularly love about
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | your Wedding? Many of our guests were very kind and complimentary, noting our wedding was straight out of a Bollywood movie! The music, dances, energy, and hype that Rohan and I brought to each wedding event and each dance really resonated with all our guests, and that’s what they remember most. This means a lot to us because we really put a lot of time and effort into all of our dances and music, and ultimately, we wanted to ensure that our guests had a great time! Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? One particularly special moment that constantly replays in our mind was performing our Bride & Groom dance at the Sangeet. It was the last dance of the performance portion of the evening, dance 13. At that point in the evening, we were both
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | exhausted having performed so many dances as well as solos, but we could not wait to perform our first official dance as Bride & Groom! Over our wedding weekend, Rohan and I performed a total of 3 dances as a couple, of which the Sangeet dance felt the most special and fun because it included all our favorite Bollywood songs like “Akhiyaan Gulab,” “Chaleya,” and “Thug Le,” and was the most upbeat and energetic dance. As mentioned in response to a different question, when our guests saw us dance, they felt like they were transported to a Bollywood movie, and that attests to how much energy and spirit we brought to our dances. This was the first time our guests saw us dance together, and it was only a taste of all the dancing and fun that was to come the rest of the wedding weekend. Feeling

SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | there are weddings that make you want to relive every single moment on repeat. Emily & Pratik's was absolutely the case with a celebration so full of joy, color, and heart that it could only have taken place at Hera’s Haven , a stunning venue that felt more like a storybook setting than a location. From a lively sangeet under the twinkle of string lights to a ceremony blooming with tradition and a reception that redefined fun, this was a South Asian wedding in full, glorious bloom. The festivities began with a sangeet that could’ve doubled as a Bollywood movie premiere (minus the paparazzi, though we’re pretty sure guests took enough photos to make up for it). Hera’s Haven set the perfect stage for laughter, performances, and family love—a true prelude to the magic that followed. Double Bl

The energy, flow, and visual storytelling of the weekend reflected their mastery of blending cultural authenticity with contemporary elegance. And let’s talk about the florals. Because, honestly, what’s a wedding without a few thousand petals and some jaw-dropping arrangements? Sage Fine Flowers and Blissful Weddings by Kiran joined creative forces to transform Hera’s Haven into a garden of dreams. Think lush blooms cascading over mandaps, vibrant garlands bursting with life, and tablescapes so chic that even Mother Nature would approve. Their floral artistry added depth, dimension, and that all-important wow factor that had every guest’s camera working overtime. The bride, rad

Tease to Please and Red Lotus Artistry , one of our beloved Platinum Guide members, made sure she was picture-perfect from every angle. Red Lotus Artistry, known for its exceptional attention to detail and expertise in bridal draping and sari styling, brought a regal yet effortless touch to Emily's look. It’s not every day you see a stylist tie six yards of elegance into art, but they made it look like second nature. Together, the glam squad ensured every look, from the vibrant sangeet ensemble to the classic ceremony attire, was worthy of its own standing ovation. The celebration was as flavorful as it was fashionable. Guests indulged in a culinary symphony curated by Mehfil Indian Cuisine and Paradize Pizza , yes, you read that right
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | . Because who says you can’t have perfectly spiced paneer and a slice of pizza heaven at the same wedding? It’s the kind of mix that proves love (and food) knows no boundaries. And when it came to entertainment, Emily & Pratik didn’t hold back. DJ Sre and Classic Pro DJ kept the dance floor alive with beats that had everyone—from the aunties to the flower girls—showing off their best moves. There were no “wallflowers” at this reception, only dance legends in the making. Mentopia Weddings captured it all on film, ensuring that every twirl, toast, and teary-eyed moment could be relived forever. Their team also added a fun twist with a lively photo booth that made sure every guest left with a little keepsake of joy.

Behind the scenes, Poshly Curated ensured that every precious moment made it to your feed. Because let’s face it—if it’s not on Instagram, did it even happen? And of course, the spiritual heart of it all—the ceremony led by the DFW Hindu Temple priest—was a moment of pure serenity. Under a floral mandap that could rival a royal garden, surrounded by family and friends, the couple exchanged vows that marked the beginning of a new chapter wrapped in
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | tradition, faith, and boundless love. From start to finish, Emily & Pratik's wedding was a feast for the senses and a reminder that South Asian weddings aren’t just events—they’re experiences. It was a celebration of artistry, culture, and pure joy. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? We met through an app called "Bumble" and went to eat some Indian food in Arlington, TX on the first date. We literally went to the mall afterwards, walked around, and ended up seeing an Avengers movie because we did not want the date to end. After a few more dates we discovered we had much in common. I knew he was "the one" when I felt comfortable bringing him around my family after 2 months of dating, and he was the first man I'd ever said "I love you" to. I had that gut ins
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | tinct that settled after I saw that he loved cats and how he was around my friends and his. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Pratik completely surprised me with how he proposed. He made up a story about going to Sapphire Pass Overlook in Colorado while we were there for a conference, and he got lost attempting to find the overlook. While we were trekking, trying to find this pass, he kept anxiously looking at his phone. I told him to go a different direction, but he was "No, I'm sure it's this way". We finally found the area, and it was so gorgeous that I started to take selfies of us. I noticed that he kept looking to the side and called him out on it. At this moment, he took a deep breath and got down on one knee, and asked me to marry him. Little did I know that he had hired a ph
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | otographer to capture this proposal and was attempting to locate him when we got there. Yet he did end up seeing him and got the signal that it was all good to start. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. Pratik and I knew we wanted to keep some of the traditional themes of both our cultures. We felt that if we found a venue that could incorporate both, we felt everything would fall in place. Once we saw the arches at Hera's Haven in Italy, Texas, we knew that this was our place. I could see how versatile it was and how beautiful all the colors would be. I googled a lot of fusion weddings to see some inspiration for the Haldi, Mehndi, and Hindu weddings, par
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ticularly from this website. I had been to enough Christian weddings that I knew exactly what elements I did and did not want. Hair and makeup were easy because I contacted both Tease to Please and Red Lotus Artistry after booking our venue. I loved the looks that Tease to Please offered, and loved how Red Lotus Artistry would help with developing the bridal look/placing all of the traditional outfits of an attire. I googled all of my outfits and spent time figuring out places that had plus-size Indian traditional attire. I was really grateful to find Andaaz Fashion because there were so many beautiful designs and looks to choose from. The overall wedding decor for each event was due to the creative mind of Kiran Khan (Weddings_by_kiran). I had given her a list of idea elements that I love
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | d, and she truly helped set it in motion. My advice is to make a list of elements that you want at your wedding and invest in people who can make that happen. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I was lucky that my in-laws purchased my wedding saree from India. I knew that I wanted to do red gold, but they helped bring it to light by finding the perfect color combination. I knew that Maharashtrian weddings usually tended to be red and green, red, or red and gold color combinations. As soon as I saw the red-gold color combination, that was what I wanted my bridal saree to be. My Christian wedding dress, I had no idea what I wanted it to be, except that it had to incorporate lace. It ended up being an A-line design. What was the most
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? The most enjoyable part of the planning process was honestly seeing the timeline come together and how all the vendors would show up. It made me feel very satisfied that Pratik and I had invested so much time in researching the people/companies. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? All of my guests absolutely loved the wedding because of the colors, the fusion aspect of it, the multiple-day event, and the food. We made sure that all guests would have multiple food and drink options. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? All of it holds a special area of my heart, but one of the highlights was during the Haldi when some of our close friends started dancing on our dance f
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | loor while others could complete the pooja for Pratik and me. You could literally feel the joy radiating off of everyone. The smiles and laughs were just so touching. It was our closest friends and family at this event too, which makes it even more memorable. For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. The Haldi and Mehndi were really fun and brightly colored. The Haldi was blue and yellow themed, something I did not think would pair well, but it looked wonderful. The dark blue atmosphere of the Mehndi matched the outfits Pratik and I wore, which was so neat! We also wanted to ensure that we had Henna on-site, where all of our guests could enjoy, so we ensured we had plenty of artists who could a
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ccommodate us. The dances for our Mehndi were very last-minute, but we had so much fun putting them together. I do recommend practicing them more frequently prior to the big day. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? It is well worth it to always book out in advance. We booked a lot of things about 10-12 months in advance. I do not regret any of that. It made our lives so much easier. Also, always invest in a wedding coordinator. I will always be grateful to Double Blessing Events, particularly Mel Ewing, for doing such an amazing job and keeping everyone in the loop and coordinated. Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) Amazon India and Etsy turned out to be one of the best places to fi

We found an amazing baker for the Christian wedding through an open house at our wedding venue. I also posted in a Facebook wedding group if anyone knew of any Indian desserts/bakers who specialized in this, and found an amazing baker who did Desi-inspired mini desserts. Tanvi was also the most wonderful person to work with!
