Farmington Hills, MI Indian Wedding by Rosy & Shaun Photography October 15, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Experience the beauty of Monica & Manuj’s big day—now unveiled on the Platinum Guide Blog ! How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? It was modern dating with a twist! We met on good old Dil Mil, but had a few common friends who vetted for each other. The first message Manuj sent to me was "Punjabi, loves dogs/Mexican food, and enjoys the beach, check to all of that, when can the dholi come?" It was love at first text, and we knew how special it was that we connected. We spent
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | the first year of dating long-distance, and eagerly waited to see one another every few weeks. They say you cannot take the Texas out of a man (and this is true!), but I took the man out of Texas! Manuj moved to Michigan for us, and our relationship flourished. I knew he was the one from all the compromises, unselfish love, and commitment he made. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? I think the absolute best part of our wedding that our guests and we loved was having our dog, Zen, be a part of our Haldi ceremony. Zen is the light of our life, and it was imperative he had a role in our wedding events. We were so touched that all our guests enjoyed his sweet company. He brought his good energy to our Haldi, and it is a forever memory! Was there a really special moment
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? Reading our vows aloud at the Hindu ceremony was the most special and loving moment. It was something we always wanted to do, and we're so happy to have that core memory. Our vows were vulnerable, raw, and we deeply expressed our profound love to each other. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? Stay calm and enjoy the planning process (as much as you can!) Once the wedding events begin, take a moment to process all that is going on because you blink and it's gone! Share your favorite moments, and don’t forget to tag us; we love seeing our maharanis shine!

SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ew York City, you just know it’s going to be unforgettable—and Anubhuti & Jinesh’s wedding was no exception. With Webster Hall as the stage, their Indian wedding had all the glitz of Broadway, the soul of tradition, and the kind of wow-factor that makes even passersby pause and wonder, “Whose party is this, and why wasn’t I invited?” Their story began just as magically: Anubhuti and Jinesh first connected on DilMil, meeting for coffee at Mud in the East Village. That very spot later became the backdrop for their first look—proof that full-circle moments are real, and New York knows how to deliver them. The historic Webster Hall , known for its legendary concerts, was transformed into a sacred space of love and celebration. Hosting both the ceremony and the reception under its soaring ceili
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ngs, this venue proved that grandeur doesn’t always mean marble palaces—it can also mean chic, urban elegance wrapped in history and character. J2Events led by the talented Rumi Shah, orchestrated the day with seamless precision. From guest flow to event timing, every moment unfolded like clockwork, giving the couple space to truly soak in the joy. They were so talented and made this event truly wonderful. Florista Decor added their artistry, telling a love story in blossoms, draping, and thoughtful textures that highlighted Webster Hall’s charm while making it feel uniquely theirs. Anubhuti’s bridal look reflected her creativity and individuality. Initially convinced all bridal lenghas looked the same, she set out to find something different. Her research led her to pichwai art, whose int
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ricate style inspired her stunning ensemble. Paired with mehndi designs by the talented Rita Shah , each motif was a blessing, a whisper of tradition etched into her hands. Nehal Mehra made the bride look like a real queen with impeccable hair and makeup. Guests were treated to flavors as rich as the celebration itself thanks to Bukhara Grill Caterers , who brought the culinary essence of India to every plate. And when it came to sweets, Sugar Sweet Sunshine and Empire Bakery stole the show—the French toast cake was gone before the bride even got a slice (a true sign of success). Cassandra Weber Photography captured it all through her lens, freezing every fleeting moment into timeless keepsakes. From candid laughter on the dance floor to quiet, stolen glances, her work ensures that Anubhut
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | i & Jinesh will never forget the energy and emotion of their big day. And because no detail was overlooked, even rentals played their role in style. Rags to Rickshaws added that playful, unique touch, proving that sometimes the smallest details make the biggest statements. For this couple, the planning process was just as enjoyable as the big day itself. Together, they designed custom invitations, logos, favors, and a wedding website—combining her creativity and his design skills to build a wedding that felt deeply personal. This wedding was a masterpiece of love, culture, and creativity. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? I met Jinesh on DilMil and our first date was coffee at Mud in the East Village! We revisited it for our first look. Share the scoop on
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | your Proposal Story! My friends told me we’re going to have a picnic and photo shoot in Brooklyn Bridge Park, Jinesh was still in his pajamas when I left and somehow he showered, changed, and beat me there to propose by the water! Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. Our wedding planner, Rumi Shah of J2R events made the process so seamless! We got to see our vision come to life and she help us create the most uniquely “us” wedding and I’m sure it wasn’t easy! How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? Honestly I went into shopping thinking all bridal lenghas look the same and pastels are so over done! I th

What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? Being creative with Jinesh! We loved working together to make custom invitations, logos, favors and our website. Jinesh used his design skills for all of it! What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? I think they loved how different it was from a typical wedding, they could experience everything special about New York in two days and had the time to explore on their own too! Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? I love our bridal party’s speeches, they we

We came back from a photo break and were immediately pulled into a packed dance floor that did not end until the venue kicked us out! I’ve never seen anything like it. For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. Our welcome night was a cruise around Manhattan that was such a special experience! The close up pass of the Statue of Liberty was so stunning and everyone enjoyed the singularly “New York” event!

SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | e us swoon, laugh, and grab the nearest box of tissues (happy tears only, of course). From the moment guests arrived at the iconic Royal Albert’s Palace , it was clear this wasn’t just a wedding; it was a full-on experience. With its grand ballrooms and timeless charm, the venue set the stage for a love story that the Bollywood gods themselves could have written. Both the ceremony and reception took place here, and trust us when we say the palace did not disappoint—it practically whispered, “Yes, this is the royal treatment you deserve.” Now, let’s talk florals and décor, because wow . Mandap Milap transformed the space into a dreamscape of color and tradition, creating a mandap that looked straight out of a modern-day fairytale. Paired with lighting and live music by the talented team at
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Kurani Studios , a proud Platinum Guide member, the atmosphere was electric. They didn’t just “do lighting”—they created moods, set the tone, and ensured that every sparkle, every beat, every corner of the room said, “This is a once-in-a-lifetime party.” They even brought their magic touch to the photo booth, because what’s a celebration without a few goofy props and keepsake snapshots? Our bride, Aaska, looked radiant with hair and makeup by the ever-talented Herneet Kaur of Glow by Herneet . This wasn’t just a glow—it was the kind of glow that comes from knowing you’re marrying your soulmate and from an expertly blended highlighter. Herneet’s artistry also extended to draping and styling, ensuring Aaska’s look was flawless from every angle (yes, even the candid shots). The celebration wa
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s sweet in more ways than one, thanks to Cakes by Ashni , who crafted treats that were as delicious as they were beautiful. Guests probably debated whether to admire the artistry or dive right into the cake—spoiler: they did both. And speaking of artistry, the lens masters at Lightyear Studio captured it all—cinematography and photography so vivid , you can almost hear the music and taste the ladoos just from looking at the images. Their highlight video is a cinematic journey in itself, proof that some moments are just too perfect not to relive again and again. For the mehndi, Shama Mehandi Artist brought her intricate magic to life, adorning Aaska’s hands with patterns as detailed as the couple’s love story. Each swirl and motif was as much a symbol as it was a piece of art. This wedding
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | had it all—tradition, joy, laughter, and a “wow factor” that left every guest buzzing long after the last song played. It’s the kind of celebration that reminds us why South Asian weddings aren’t just events; they’re epics . If you’re dreaming up your own happily-ever-after, take a cue from Aaska & Kishan’s big day.
