COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Puerto Vallarta, MX Indian Wedding by Jagat Studio October 22, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Welcome to the mesmerizing tale of Serena & Harsh's wedding in today's Platinum Guide Blog . Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Harsh proposed on Sunset Beach in Dubai in December 2023! He told me we were just going to watch the sunset, but he secretly had a photographer waiting to capture the moment. When he got down on one knee with the Dubai skyline behind us and the sun setting over the water, it honestly couldn’t have been more perfect. We even did a little photoshoot afterward, and if you know me, you know I’m a total sucker for sunsets, so it was everything I could’ve dreamed of. Tell us how you went about planning your
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. I actually had so much fun planning my wedding! I had a clear vision for each event, which made the entire process feel organized and intentional. I didn’t want anything to feel too minimal or overly extravagant, and in the end, we had the perfect balance between decor and entertainment across every celebration. I worked with Nirali Shah Events, and they were with me every step of the way throughout the year-long planning process. While wedding planning can definitely get stressful, Nirali always had an answer for everything and seamlessly coordinated all our vendors. Thanks to her and her team, everything came together even better than I imagined. How did you
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I worked with Panache by Sharmeen in Houston, Texas, and Sharmeen’s collection of bridal lehengas and event outfits is absolutely stunning. I ordered each one of my outfits from her. I originally thought I wanted something in pastel tones, but when I tried on an ivory Seema Gujral lehenga, I instantly fell in love. My mom had her heart set on pink or red, so we found the perfect balance: the ceremony decor was done entirely in shades of white, ivory, peach, pink and red, and our close family, bridesmaids, and groomsmen all wore pink to tie it together beautifully. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? Working with Nirali Shah Events was truly the highlight of our entire planning
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | process! Nirali and her team are one of a kind. They redefine what luxury means. I trusted her completely at every stage, even when it came to selecting our vendors, and that trust paid off in every possible way. Thanks to her meticulous attention to detail, every aspect of our wedding came together seamlessly, allowing us to fully relax and enjoy each event! Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? Walking down the aisle and seeing the sun shining on the mandap, with my parents right across from me, is a moment I’ll never forget. It looked and felt absolutely ethereal. And of course… the first look with my husband! For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | details. For our welcome party, we wanted a desert tropical vibe, relaxed yet vibrant, with everyone dressed in tropical chic to kick off our beachside wedding weekend. Harsh and I played the shoe game with both families hollering who they thought we would pick for each question. It was a great way to break the ice with everyone! By the end of the night, it turned into a full-on dance party, with everyone so excited to celebrate together. Our Haldi was set against such breathtaking views that the scenery itself became the main decor. We just added a touch of charm with roses and beautiful pom seating to complete the setting. My family eventually tore off Harsh's shirt as tradition with "Turn the TV Off" by Kendrick playing in the background, specifically the "Mustard" part of the song. It
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | was a hilarious touch by our DJ, DJ Jusi. Our Sangeet was bright, colorful, and full of energy, complete with disco balls, a decorated shot wall with a custom sign stating "Masti and Mojitos", a checker board, pink and white dance floor, and a beautifully decorated head table. It was my favorite event of all, from the family performances to the garba that everyone ended up participating in and dance party, every moment flowed perfectly. For our reception, we shifted the mood completely. With bold red and black accents, it was dramatic and refined. It was truly a stunning contrast to the vibrant, colorful events that came before. The change surprised everyone in the best way. We also had sparklers added during our entrance and our first dance, and that made the pictures pop! Do you have an

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Kissimmee, FL Indian Wedding by PTaufiq Photography October 21, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some weddings sparkle, some shine, and then there are weddings like Sanjana & Vikas’s, where every single detail feels like a standing ovation moment. Hosted at the breathtaking Gaylord Palms Resort , this celebration was more than just a wedding—it was an all-out production that blended tradition, luxury, and sheer joy. Picture this: a sangeet that looked like it could headline its own Broadway show, a ceremony that turned vows into poetry, and a reception where no one wanted to leave the dance floor. Guiding this magnificent journey was Weldone Event
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s , the creative powerhouse that orchestrated each moment with precision and artistry. And when it came to florals and décor, Elegant Affairs proved why they’re renowned in the South Asian wedding industry. Imagine towering floral installations, luxe accents that danced in the candlelight, and mandap décor that could rival royal palaces. Of course, no maharani is complete without her regal touch, and Sanjana was nothing short of dazzling in her Manish Malhotra masterpiece. The gown wasn’t just worn ; it was owned . Shades With Prithvi LLC took the look further with hair and makeup that highlighted her natural beauty while adding that unforgettable bridal glow—proof that the right glam squad can turn butterflies into confidence. Amrita Henna worked her magic too, painting intricate designs

The senses were spoiled at every turn. 5th Element Taste of India curated a menu that made guests swoon with every bite. Amplifire Entertainment kept the party alive with beats that could wake even the most tired feet back onto the dance floor. And just when you thought it couldn’t get any better, the live performances stepped in. Tamara Violin and Sumanth Swaminathan brought live instrumental magic that tugged at the heartstrings, adding an unforgettable soundtrack to the couple’s big day. Behind the lens, PTaufiq Photography captured it all—those fleeting expressions, the grandeur of the décor, the laughter during toasts, and the tears during vows. Their photography turned moments into heirlooms. Complementing this visual

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Seal Beach, CA Gujarati Wedding by Balerina Films October 17, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some love stories are written in the stars. Others, like Himani & Jay's, are written page by page, scrapbook after scrapbook, memory after memory. The very first gift Jay (yes, our groom, with the most fitting name for a love story) gave his bride was an empty scrapbook. Every year since, she filled it with their milestones—ticket stubs, photos, inside jokes—until a collection of volum
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | es told the tale of two souls growing up together, side by side. By the time their wedding arrived, they weren’t just exchanging vows; they were opening the next chapter in a novel already overflowing with love. Their celebrations unfolded across iconic California venues, with the Marina del Rey Marriott and Old Ranch Country Club providing dreamy backdrops that felt straight out of a modern fairytale. Promises Forever Events orchestrated the weekend with a steady hand and sharp eye, while Royal Ball Designs transformed spaces into living works of art, layering florals, draping, and design in ways that felt both regal and deeply personal. For the bohemian-themed Pithi, Himani chose a neutral green palazzo set from Kalista , accented with pink florals. The Sangeet was nothing less than lege

Guests walked through a ten-foot storybook at the entrance, complete with a poem penned by the bride, before stepping into a night that sparkled with dance, music, and raw emotion. This meant honoring years of classical Bharatanatyam with a solo performance, followed by a reunion set with Raas teammates. Dressed in emerald green and champagne by Jigar and Nikita , while Jay matched in an emerald sherwani, the couple looked like vibrant kalis stitched right into the heart of their own fairytale. The wedding day itself was anchored in meaning and emotion. A line of life-sized Polaroid posters carried by the groomsmen traced every June 14th the couple had shared—first date, proposal, marriage license, and now wedding day—bringing even the toughest groomsmen (and, yes, the groom himself
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ) to tears. The ceremony programs, printed as whimsical newspapers titled The Once Upon a Times , had guests chuckling and tearing up all at once as they read articles about the couple’s journey. Himani chose to step outside tradition in a breathtaking pearl-encrusted lehenga by Rianta’s , complete with a Victorian-style pearl veil that looked like something conjured from a dream. Jay mirrored her elegance in a blush sherwani, equally detailed and unforgettable. For the reception, Marina del Rey Marriott unveiled its panoramic rooftop view of the ocean and downtown Los Angeles, where guests gathered in coordinated silver and white attire. Against the grayscale backdrop, Himani commanded the room in a scarlet Isa by Dolly Wahal lehenga, bold and unapologetic, while Jay looked every bit the

From the tender black-and-white stillness of the posters, to the baraat led by the energy of Dheer’s dhol, to the vibrant whirl of the Sangeet performances, their lens didn’t just record the wedding—it narrated it. Watching their film feels like stepping right into the couple’s scrapbook, page by page, but with the cinematic magic of a fairytale.
