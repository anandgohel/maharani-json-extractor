Indianapolis, IN Indian Wedding by WSS Weddings December 30, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some weddings unfold, scene by scene, like a perfectly paced Bollywood blockbuster—where every frame feels intentional, every emotion lands just right, and the audience (a.k.a. the guests) is fully invested from the opening scene. Sanjana & Rohit’s celebration was exactly that kind of cinematic magic, rooted in a love story that began long before wedding planning ever entered the chat. Their story goes all the way back to the 6th-grade orchestra, where a simple introduction sparked an instant childhood crush. Fast forward th
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | rough years of growing up, growing together, and building a shared rhythm, and it was clear this was always heading somewhere special. Rohit’s proposal sealed the deal in the most heartfelt way—behind Sanjana’s home, in a garden with a clock tower where they once dated, surrounded by family and surprised by best friends flown in just for the moment. Romantic, thoughtful, and deeply personal… the tone was set. That same sense of meaning carried through every detail of their wedding. The festivities began at the stunning JPS Events at Regions Tower , where modern architecture met timeless tradition. The ceremony space felt elevated in every sense—literally and figuratively—with clean lines, warm florals, and intentional décor framing the mandap. JPS Events didn’t just host the ceremony; they
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | stepped in as décor experts, ensuring each ritual flowed seamlessly. Sitting together on the mandap, bathed in sunlight and surrounded by loved ones, became one of those quiet, sacred moments the couple says will replay in their minds forever. What makes this celebration even more special? It was planned entirely without a formal wedding planner. Instead, Sanjana & Rohit leaned into what mattered most—family. Every relative poured their heart into the details, turning the process into a true labor of love and a celebration of two families becoming one. Their journey even took them to India twice—once for Sanjana’s dream bridal shopping experience with her parents, and again for a heartfelt engagement celebration in Rohit’s ancestral village, grounding the wedding in heritage and shared ro
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ots. Speaking of bridal dreams—Sanjana knew from the start that red was non-negotiable. Her bridal lehenga, a rich bougainvillea hue inspired by flowers her mother grew up with in Bangalore, struck the perfect balance between West Coast elegance and Eastern tradition. Designed by Jigar and Nikita , the look was deeply symbolic, right down to the custom veil adorned with butterflies representing Sanjana and a peacock honoring Rohit’s village. Even her mehndi told a story—designed over the course of a year with a dear aunt, featuring portraits of her dogs, village peacocks, and meaningful florals woven into the design. Her jewelry, hand-selected at Curio Cottage , completed a look that felt both intentional and timeless. As the celebrations continued, the mood shifted beautifully. The haldi
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | and mehndi took place in Sanjana’s backyard—an Italian villa–style setting transformed into a sun-soaked celebration filled with yellow hues, joyful color rules for guests, and a relaxed, love-filled atmosphere. Later, the reception at Embassy Suites Noblesville unfolded in rich burgundy and plum tones, with star lights overhead and a room so expansive it practically begged for a party. And yes—they delivered. Ace Party and Tents transformed the space into a whimsical, rave-worthy celebration that guests are still talking about months later. And then there was the dancing in charge of DJ Imallin . With choreography planned as surprises for each other—and involving siblings on both sides—the performances felt cinematic, polished, and deeply emotional. Sanjana & Rohit brought movie-level ene
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | rgy to the floor, and guests absolutely felt it. Six months later? People are still bringing it up. Food, of course, played its starring role. Madurai Virundhu and Incredible India US delivered flavors that were comforting, indulgent, and unforgettable—the kind of meals guests reminisce about long after the wedding is over. And the celebrations didn’t end there. The following day was wrapped with an intimate lakeside lunch at the in-laws’ home, complete with incredible food and the kind of quiet joy that only comes after an epic few days of celebration. Capturing it all was WSS Weddings , our Platinum Guide members, whose photography and cinematography preserved not just the visuals , but the emotion of the entire experience. Their storytelling felt cinematic yet intimate—every glance, lau
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | gh, and tear documented with heart and artistry. When a team understands culture, pacing, and feeling this well, the result is timeless—and this wedding is proof . Sanjana & Rohit’s wedding was elegant without being stiff, joyful without being chaotic, and deeply personal at every turn. It’s a reminder that when you trust the process, lean on your community, and face every challenge together, the result is something truly unforgettable. Their words of wisdom for future brides? Let go. Trust your family. Embrace the chaos and the beauty—because a wedding isn’t just about perfection, it’s about connection. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? In the 6th-grade orchestra! I went up to him and introduced myself, and we immediately had a childhood crush on each oth

He surprised me behind my house, there is a beautiful garden and clock tower where we began dating, and he had our family together and flew in our best friends to have a magical night. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. It was amazing. We went to India twice, once for my dream bridal shopping trip with my parents and once for our engagement in a small village where Rohit is from and has grown up. It was a wonderful celebration of two families coming together. We had no planner, and every family member poured their heart and soul into every detail :) How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | have a favorite color in mind? Red for sure. I wanted a blend of West Coast pearls and our Eastern culture. I chose my dress to be a boganvilla color, which my mother grew up with in Bangalore. They are called Jigar and Nikita, and it felt like a perfect blend of modern and traditional. I customized my veil with butterflies (me) and a peacock from his village. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? Dancing… we had choreographed the most amazing sequences and made them as surprises for each other, including both of our siblings. Everyone showed up and showed out, and it was like a movie :) What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? The dances! We have a lot of dancing background, so I don’t believe people realized the quality of them. They enjoye

Sitting on the madam, it was serene, and the sun was shining on us with all of our family on the Mandan. For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. The Haldi was a beautiful backyard ceremony. My house is like an Italian villa, and we planned the whole whole mehendi and Haldi to be a beautiful celebration. Lots of yellow, and the guests had to be in all other colors! The reception was a beautiful burgundy and plum. It felt whimsical and magical. The room was huge with star lights, and we threw our own rave! The day after was a lunch at our in-l
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | aws' house overlooking the lake with amazing food. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? I would most say, let go and trust the process. Even if you are scared and prefer things intimate, remember your strength is your family and community. A wedding brings everyone together regardless of the food and bad. Embrace it all, and every time you and your partner are together against the problem, always. Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) I had designed my mehendi with a dear aunty for over a year with portraits of both my dogs, peacocks from his village, and flowers from my life.

Think cinematic energy, elegant tradition, and just the right amount of sparkle to make guests pause mid-conversation and say, “Wow.” With a guest count hovering between 201– 300, this celebration was designed to be felt, not just attended.
