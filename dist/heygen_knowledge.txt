The soundtrack to this spectacular celebration was pure fire. DJ Josh Rajkumar (JRK) and DJ Barz (Harshil Patel) took turns spinning beats that had everyone from the flower girl to grandma vibing on the dance floor. If energy could be bottled, these two would be billionaires. Their playlists flawlessly blended Bollywood bangers, Top 40 hits, and just enough throwback
