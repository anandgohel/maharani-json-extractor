COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Queens, NY Indian Wedding by 17th Eclipse & Sakif Chowdhury September 30, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some love stories stroll in; Anisah & Maheeb’s arrives with skyline views, a confetti trail of rose petals, and a perfectly timed plot twist. They met thanks to a cousin-led “executive search” on a dating ap
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | p—Mashi and Tanjil vetted the contenders, spotted his humor, and the LIC Piers became their meet-cute backdrop. Fast-forward to a spring day at the same waterfront: letters held by loved ones, a petal path, a glowing “Marry Me” sign, and a groom on one knee with Manhattan approving from across the river. Consider us swooning. Their celebration unfolded across New York in three vibrant chapters—Holud/Mehndi at World’s Fair Marina, a radiant ceremony at Terrace on the Park, and a grand reception under the soaring ceilings of Hyatt Regency Long Island . With a 450–500 guest list and bi-coastal planning (hello, California commute!), the couple leaned on an all-star team to turn vision into reality. The reception design was a showstopper: an enchanted-garden dream of soft pinks and whites, crys
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | tal chandeliers, and lush blooms that let Anisah’s deep red bridal look pop like a jewel. Elegantize Productions —our Platinum Guide member—read her Pinterest board like a score and conducted the room to perfection. Led by Reza, they balanced romance and architecture, from sculptural aisles to a regal stage, and still found time to quarterback wedding-day curveballs for the bridal party. That’s the PG difference: vetted expertise, cultural fluency, and execution that feels effortless to guests and magazine-worthy on camera. Fashion was a love letter to tradition with a couture twist. For the Nikkah, Anisah channeled Katrina Kaif in a custom-ivory Sabyasachi saree with a cathedral-length veil—measured entirely over video calls and delivered with glove-fit precision. Reception night belonged
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | to a classic crimson lehenga from Marwar Couture , chosen in minutes on her first day in Delhi (when you know, you know). The Holud look—a Rimple & Harpreet rani-style ensemble—paired with long crimped hair and heirloom-chic jewelry by Kirni Designs captured that “Heeramandi heroine” energy. Gold from Sona Jewelers completed the glow, while Suit Supply and Sammaira Man kept the groom sharply in step. The Holud itself was pure joy: a citrus-bright palette, a colorful rickshaw entrance, matching family outfits, and a boba tea cart from Boba Baar Baar because this couple understands love languages (acts of service, quality time, and tapioca pearls). Fam Henna worked her intricate magic—twice!—and the dance performances choreographed by family brought the house down. Later, at the reception,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | DJ Mahi owned crowd control and the dance floor, with a cameo by our bride in the DJ booth spinning “Baby” and “Forever” for the happiest kind of nostalgia. Rain tried to steal a scene on the wedding day, but the creative team simply rewrote the script. 17th Eclipse and Sakif Chowdhury delivered luminous imagery indoors, then surprised the newlyweds with an outdoor portrait redo the following weekend—cinematic, sun-kissed, and exactly what the couple had dreamed of. Neon Skies Films captured the rhythm of it all with modern storytelling, while Action Jackson Cinema preserved the ceremony’s tenderness. And when guests needed a sweet intermission, BakedBySaira’s towering cake and 400+ dessert shooters proved that dessert can, in fact, be a personality trait. Anisah & Maheeb planned with inte
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ntion, loved out loud, and trusted the right people—then New York did what New York does: turned their story into a classic. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? I met my now-husband, Maheeb, on a dating app. My cousin/best friend Mashi and Tanjil had created the dating app for me. So initially they were talking to most of the people on the app to vet out the people for me. They did troll a lot of people, but as soon as Mashi spoke to Maheeb she was like oh he's funny. From then on we started talking day and night. We went on our first date soon after we started talking, at the LIC Piers in New York City. It was one of the most genuine and deep conversations I’d ever had, and we clicked immediately. From that day on, we were inseparable. We’re both very indep
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | endent people, yet we found ourselves always wanting to be together. The biggest sign for me came later that year, when I had to move from NYC to California for work. I feared our connection might fade like a summer romance, but he reassured me and said he would come with me to support my career. He sacrificed so much to be by my side, and for that I’m forever grateful and lucky to have a partner like him. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Our proposal was in May 2023, and—ironically—I unknowingly helped my friends and husband plan the surprise. I had arranged a rooftop day with everyone at the LIC Piers to enjoy the beautiful spring weather in NYC while I was visiting. A week earlier, I’d broken a nail and had to see my nail tech that morning to prevent it from getting worse. My fri
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ends secretly texted her to give me a simple look, and I’m easily convinced, so she did a soft pink-and-white ombré design. My then-boyfriend had taken my car because I didn’t want to deal with NYC parking, and my friends were supposed to pick me up so we could all meet at the pier. Since he usually runs late, he said, “I’ll go with your car to the pier—you go with your friends.” I thought nothing of it, got dressed, and met Mashi downstairs; she drove me to the LIC Piers, where we’d had our first date. He was waiting at the end of the pier with the NYC skyline behind him. Our friends and family stood along the path, each holding a letter for me, and a trail of flower petals led to a “Marry Me” sign where he waited with my ring. He dropped to one knee, and the rest was history. He knew me
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | so well that he turned my type-A, always-planning personality into the perfect setup for a proposal I never saw coming. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. Planning our wedding was exciting but challenging. We decided to have our Nikkah first in 2023 so we could move into our apartment in California. Planning from such a distance wasn’t easy, but we coordinated everything carefully and flew to New York every couple of months to tour venues and meet with vendors. Our friends and family were incredible—they helped us find trusted contacts and handled so many details when we couldn’t be there. For décor, we spoke with several decorators but were ultimately re
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | commended to Elegantize Productions by a family member, Jay. After meeting and talking with Reza, I immediately knew he understood my vision. I had always imagined an enchanted-garden theme—romantic yet classy—with pink and white roses and chandeliers to complement my deep red outfit. I wanted the red to pop against those soft colors. Reza grasped exactly what I envisioned and brought it to life. I even sent him my Pinterest board, and he knew right away what I was going for. On the wedding day my jaw was on the floor when i saw all the hard work come to life. Reza and the team were also such great help on such a stressful day. They were helping my bridal party handle so many difficult obstacles while they were busy decorating and putting my wedding together. When it came to the venue, we
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | toured many locations. With a guest list of 450–500, we needed a very large space, which is hard to find in NYC. My main requirement was high ceilings to make the room feel open and grand. As soon as we saw the ballroom at the Hyatt Regency, we knew it was perfect. I especially wanted a New York venue—rather than New Jersey—because that’s where our families live, making it more convenient for everyone. From the moment I knew I was getting married, I dreamed of having my hair and makeup done by Nishi Artistry. I’ve always been a huge fan of her work, and it was a dream come true to book her for my Nikkah and Holud/Mehndi day. I even scheduled the Mehndi based on her availability! For the reception, when she wasn’t available, I found Emaan Makeup. After seeing her portfolio, I knew I’d love
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | her style, and she exceeded every expectation—highlighting my natural beauty while making me feel like a truly radiant bride. Our photographer was another dream come true—and to my luck, he’s a good friend of my husband’s. He went above and beyond to capture our vision, and I feel so fortunate to have worked with him. Our videographer was recommended by my sister-in-law, Nera, and our wedding videos turned out absolutely amazing. He understood the assignment perfectly and delivered exactly what we had envisioned. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? I knew from the moment I got engaged exactly which looks I wanted to create. For my ceremony, I envisioned something white—a fusion of South Asian and American culture. I wanted a long w
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | hite veil and a white dress with a South Asian touch. After seeing Katrina Kaif’s wedding saree, I knew I wanted the same style, but in ivory. I called Sabyasachi, thinking it couldn’t hurt to ask about a custom ivory look. I knew it was a long shot, especially reaching out from NYC before their New York store had opened. To my surprise, they were just about to release an ivory version. I immediately placed my order over the phone to be shipped to New York. After multiple video calls and measurement sessions—without anyone physically measuring me—Sabyasachi delivered one of the most stunning sarees and best-fitting blouses I’ve ever worn with the matching veil. For my reception, I always dreamed of wearing a full traditional deep red. I’m very particular about red lehengas, so I knew I had
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | to try them on to find the perfect shade. My in-laws sent me to Delhi to choose my outfit. My husband and I went alone, and our first stop was Marwar Couture. Within minutes of entering the store and receiving the ultimate bridal treatment, I put on a lehenga and instantly knew it was the one. I’d never said “yes” to something so quickly. On my very first bridal-shopping day in Delhi, I found my dream outfit. After about five months—and many video calls and virtual measurements—I received the lehenga of my dreams. It fit absolutely perfectly. My bridal experience for both outfits was exceptional; I couldn’t have imagined a better one. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? The most enjoyable part of the planning process was watching my vision slowly come to lif
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | e. I did all the planning myself because I wanted to handle every aspect of the wedding. It was definitely a lot of work—something I wouldn’t necessarily recommend—but seeing it all come together was truly the best part. I also have a very large family in New York, and it meant so much to see both my husband’s family and mine come together to support us. Throughout every step of the planning process, our families were there to fully support our vision. I truly could not have achieved any of it without them, and seeing everyone’s personal touch in the wedding made it all the more special for me. The décor was what I thought and dreamed about day and night. Sitting down with Reza and the rest of the team at Elegantize Productions and watching my ideas take shape was such a joy. I think it’s
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | every little girl’s dream to create her own fairytale wedding, and I’m so happy I can say that about mine. From choosing the colors and backdrop style to selecting the chairs and every small detail of the tables and centerpieces, every choice mattered. Walking into the ballroom and seeing it all perfectly come together was an absolute dream. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? I know our guests enjoyed every part of our wedding—from the food to the décor to the hospitality. With such a large guest list and no wedding planner, my family truly pulled through to keep everything organized and ensure that all our guests were well looked after. I can’t thank them enough. It was so organized we almost got photos with all of our 400+ guests. A special shout-out goes to my pa
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | rents; my in-laws; my brother and sister-in-law, Renadh and Nera; my maid of honor, Nushin, and her amazing husband Nafis; my aunt and uncle, Mehrin and Minhaz; and my younger cousins, Mashi, Sareena, and Sadiah. Honestly, my entire family—and so many more people—deserve credit. There are always mishaps on a wedding day that a bride can’t manage herself, and I’m the type who likes to handle everything. But thanks to my incredible tribe, I didn’t have to worry about a thing. Everyone loved our DJ Mahi. He did such a great job with crowd control, and of course, we had a great night dancing the night away, even with a feature of me in the DJ booth playing my all-time faves, Baby by Justin Bieber and Forever by Chris Brown. Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly repl
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ays in your mind? Some of the most special moments of our wedding were the heartfelt speeches—I had been looking forward to them the most. Our fathers gave a perfect mix of funny and touching words, setting the tone beautifully. I became especially emotional during my brother-in-law Renadh’s speech. My husband and his brother don’t often show affection, but their bond runs so deep, and hearing Renadh speak about it made me emotional. My husband’s best friend, Sakib, brought the perfect dose of comedy, keeping everyone laughing, while my little sister, Sareena, made me tear up with her sweet words about how much she looks up to me. And of course, my maid of honor, Nushin, touched my heart as she reminisced about how we grew up from little girls to strong women. At the end of the night, I fe
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | lt like I had danced all my stress away. Being able to dance with all the people i love under the same roof. Then, walking out to everyone I love, holding sparklers was the end to such a magical night. For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. For my mendhi outfit and look, I knew I wanted to have a Heeramandi kind of look. I wanted the look to be different with long crimped hair and a Rajasthani-style outfit. I was able to find this multi-colored outfit in Delhi from Rimple & Harpreet. The minute I put on the outfit, I knew it would be perfect for the look I was going for. We also took out parts of the can-can to ensure that I would be able to dance the night away. My jewelry for the mendhi wa
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s custom-made by Kirni Designs. I showed her an inspirational picture, and she executed exactly what I was looking for. My beautiful mendhi was done by Henna by Fahmida @fam_henna. She spent almost 9 hours doing my hands and feet, and she did it twice, once for my ceremony and then again a year later for my reception. I couldn't be more pleased with how it turned out, and I fully trusted her to freestyle each time, and I would not change a thing about how it turned out. Since our wedding was during the summer, I wanted a fun, citrus-themed mendhi with fun pops of summer colors. We incorporated parts of our culture by entering in a colorful rickshaw. We also had a boba tea cart for our guests because we love bubble tea. Our dalas/taals were so elegantly put together by my sister in law, Ner
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | a, and my mother-in-law. We bought matching outfits for both our families on both sides, orange for my side and green for my cousins. My mother-in-law helped choose the perfect colors as well hand hand-printing all the men's scarves. My favorite part of our holud/mendhi night was our dances. My sister in law Nera, my little cousin Sareena, and my husband choreographed everything. They ate with their routines, and they did such a great job choreographing it was such a fun and entertaining night for us and our guests. Everyone loved every single performance. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? My words of wisdom for brides-to-be are to stay true to your own dreams and vision. It can be challenging to balance family expectations with what you really want, but remember: this is y

We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) The wedding day itself was quite stressful. My bridal party and my brother and sister-in-law were running around all morning to make sure everything was perfectly set. We had originally scheduled our pre-shoot in a beautiful park, but by afternoon, it began to pour, and the rain lasted well into the evening. My maid of honor, Nushin—makeup half done—and her husband, Nafis, rushed to find a new location for our first l
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ook and pre-wedding photos. They even lifted my 50-pound wedding dress into a golf cart and drove me all over the property trying to beat the rain. Unfortunately, we had to take all our pictures indoors. Even so, our photographers—Abdul Moontarin (a.k.a. 17theclipse) and Sakif—and our videographer Sam (a.k.a. Neon Skies Films) captured the most stunning shots. I’m still amazed at how beautifully they documented the day despite the change of plans. To make it even more special, Abdul and Sam surprised us with an outdoor shoot the following weekend at the same park we’d originally planned for. Yes, we got dolled up again in our wedding outfits, and the talented up-and-coming makeup artist BeautyByDaaya gave me a flawless last-minute look. Thanks to them, we were able to fulfill one of our we
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | dding-day wishes, and I can’t thank Abdul and Sam enough for going above and beyond. The best part of any wedding is truly the incredible team working behind the scenes. My jewelry was a gold set from Sona Jewelers in New Jersey. Yes—I’m one of those brides who wore her actual gold pieces. My mother and father-in-law gave me complete freedom to choose whatever I wanted. The moment I tried on that set, I knew it was the one for my wedding day. The challenge came when I tried to find matching pieces. I wanted to pair it with a longer necklace, a matha patti, and a nose ring. My brother and sister-in-law, Renaha and Nera, took me to nearly every jewelry store in Edison, New Jersey, just weeks before the wedding to find the perfect match. On the big day, when I finally put everything together,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | I couldn’t believe how perfectly it all came out. Our beautiful cake and dessert table were created by the incredibly talented BakedBySaira. Over the years, Saira has made many of our family’s cakes, so I knew she was the one I wanted for our wedding. It was a big request—our wedding cake plus more than 400 dessert shooters for the guests—and she’s an independent baker, not a full bakery. Yet she happily accepted and delivered the most delicious and gorgeous desserts and cakes. I can’t recommend her enough; she’s truly gifted and someone I knew I could trust completely. Overall, my true sentiment about our wedding is that your tribe matters so much—both the loved ones you include in your wedding party and the vendors you choose. It’s essential to love, honor, and respect everyone who play
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s a part in your celebration. My dreams and visions would not have come true without everyone’s help. Through it all was my husband, picking up my stress every step of the way. He made sure to take care of every single aspect of the wedding. Everything i mentioned he had a hand in, he had an opinion on or he did the labor and took care of it himself. A wedding day should be filled with unconditional love from all around—that’s what makes it truly meaningful. Tap our Platinum Guide to connect with more fabulous vendors.
