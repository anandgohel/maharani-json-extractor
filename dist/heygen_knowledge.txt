Kissimmee, FL Indian Wedding by PTaufiq Photography October 21, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Some weddings sparkle, some shine, and then there are weddings like Sanjana & Vikas’s, where every single detail feels like a standing ovation moment. Hosted at the breathtaking Gaylord Palms Resort , this celebration was more than just a wedding—it was an all-out production that blended tradition, luxury, and sheer joy. Picture this: a sangeet that looked like it could headline its own Broadway show, a ceremony that turned vows into poetry, and a reception where no one wanted to leave the dance floor. Guiding this magnificent

And when it came to florals and décor, Elegant Affairs proved why they’re renowned in the South Asian wedding industry.

Of course, no maharani is complete without her regal touch, and Sanjana was nothing short of dazzling in her Manish Malhotra masterpiece. The gown wasn’t just worn ; it was owned . Shades With Prithvi LLC took the look further with hair and makeup that highlighted her natural beauty while adding that unforgettable bridal glow—proof that the right glam squad can turn butterflies into confidence.

The senses were spoiled at every turn. 5th Element Taste of India curated a menu that made guests swoon with every bite. Amplifire Entertainment kept the party alive with beats that could wake even the most tired feet back onto the dance floor. And just when you thought it couldn’t get any better, the live performances stepped in. Tamara Violin and Sumanth Swaminathan brought live instrumental magic that tugged at the heartstrings, adding an unforgettable soundtrack to the couple’s big day.

Others, like Himani & Jay's, are written page by page, scrapbook after scrapbook, memory after memory. The very first gift Jay (yes, our groom, with the most fitting name for a love story) gave his bride was an empty scrapbook.

By the time their wedding arrived, they weren’t just exchanging vows; they were opening the next chapter in a novel already overflowing with love. Their celebrations unfolded across iconic California venues, with the Marina del Rey Marriott and Old Ranch Country Club providing dreamy backdrops that felt straight out of a modern fairytale. Promises Forever Events orchestrated the weekend with a steady hand and sharp eye, while Royal Ball Designs transformed spaces into living works of art, layering florals, draping, and design in ways that felt both regal and deeply personal. For the bohemian-themed Pithi, Himani chose a neutral green palazzo set from Kalista , accented with pink florals. The Sangeet w

Guests walked through a ten-foot storybook at the entrance, complete with a poem penned by the bride, before stepping into a night that sparkled with dance, music, and raw emotion. This meant honoring years of classical Bharatanatyam with a solo performance, followed by a reunion set with Raas teammates. Dressed in emerald green and champagne by Jigar and Nikita , while Jay matched in an emerald sherwani, the couple looked like vibrant kalis stitched right into the heart of their own fairytale. The wedding day itself was anchored in meaning and emotion. A line of life-sized Polaroid posters carried by the groomsmen traced every June 14th the couple had shared—first date, proposal, marriage license, and now wedding day—bringing even the toughest groomsmen (an

The ceremony programs, printed as whimsical newspapers titled The Once Upon a Times , had guests chuckling and tearing up all at once as they read articles about the couple’s journey. Himani chose to step outside tradition in a breathtaking pearl-encrusted lehenga by Rianta’s , complete with a Victorian-style pearl veil that looked like something conjured from a dream. Jay mirrored her elegance in a blush sherwani, equally detailed and unforgettable. For the reception, Marina del Rey Marriott unveiled its panoramic rooftop view of the ocean and downtown Los Angeles, where guests gathered in coordinated silver and white attire. Against the grayscale backdrop, Himani commanded the room in a scarlet Isa by Dolly Wahal lehenga, bold and unapologetic, while

From the tender black-and-white stillness of the posters, to the baraat led by the energy of Dheer’s dhol, to the vibrant whirl of the Sangeet performances, their lens didn’t just record the wedding—it narrated it.

SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | Shawna Comments Sometimes, love stories are written in the stars. Other times, they’re written in an online dating app bio. For Shikha & Vipul, it was the latter — proof that swiping right can, in fact, lead to forever. After years of not having much luck, Shikha suddenly found herself in sync with someone who just clicked . A year later came the proposal, and six months after that, a wedding that was nothing short of spectacular. And when we say spectacular, we mean a four-event, Excel-sheet-and-shared-Notes extravaganza that managed to blend family traditions, Bollywood glamour, and a touch of surprise at every turn. Planning such an epic celebration in half a year while juggling full-time jobs? Let’s just say Shikha &Vipul deserve a gold medal in multitasking. The festivities kicked of

When the big day arrived, the Four Seasons Hotel Baltimore became the backdrop for a ceremony that was pure magic. But let’s talk about the mastermind who held it all together: Events By Vaishali . From planning and design to executing every last detail. They not only balanced the logistics of multiple venues, but also worked with Partyland Sajawat to craft décor that made jaws drop. No South Asian wedding is complete without unforgettable looks, and Style by Susmita delivered bridal glam that made Shikha shine like royalty. Her ensembles were equally stunning: a Papa Don’t Preach outfit fo
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | r the mehndi, a regal Nitika Gujral lengha for the ceremony, and a dazzling Seema Gujral gown for the reception. Add in statement jewelry from Om Sons Bridal Store , and every look was Insta-worthy from head to toe. Music and energy stayed at an all-time high thanks to Premier Entertainment , which handled both DJ and baraat. From karaoke at the mehndi to setting the perfect dance floor vibe at the reception, they made sure no one’s feet left the floor. And if that wasn’t enough, Pavan Verma’s live saxophone and flute melodies created goosebump-worthy soundtracks for both ceremony and cocktail hour. Henna artistry by Bhavna’s Henna brought the delicate tradition to life, while custom dance floor wraps by GoToShout elevated the reception space to a showstopper. Guests indulged in culinary d

Capturing it all was the incomparable Nayeem Vohra Photography , whose lens didn’t just freeze moments but told Shikha and Vipul’s story frame by frame. From tender glances to dance floor mayhem, every shot was pitch-perfect — proof of why he’s a favorite for couples who want both artistry and heart in their memories. It was more than a wedding. It was an experience, a testament to love, family, and the beauty of blending tradition with personal flair. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"?

Our first date had some eavesdroppers who were sitting next to us & when he went to the restroom, they tapped me on the shoulder and were shocked that we were only on a first date! Even though it was a "school night," we closed the bar down & the rest was history. Even though I'll never admit it to him, I knew he was the one pretty early on. I was in my GI fellowship at the time which can be really demanding, and he was endlessly supportive. From the start, we dated with intention.

Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. We actually started planning our wedding before we were even engaged! Having attended so many weddings together, we quickly became experts in what worked (and what we’d do differently). Through those experiences, we organically discovered many of our own vendors. We started a little backward by hunting for venues first. After touring multiple options, we ultimately chose a beautiful location at the Inner Harbor in Baltimore - perfectly situated between both sides of our families. Our vision was for everyone to move into the hotel for the entire weekend so that it felt like one big family reunion rather th
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | an a series of separate events. We did everything but the wedding ceremony at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, which is where all our guests were staying. The baraat was super fun since it walked my husband's side from the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront, where they were staying, to the wedding venue at the Four Seasons with the backdrop of the Inner Harbor! I even got to pop out of one of the Four Seasons' terraces that overlooked the baraat walk for a quick cameo!! By the time we found our wedding planner - Events By Vaishali, we already had the venue booked - but she was truly our saving grace. Her team coordinated every vendor, handled all the moving parts, and, most importantly, ensured the weekend ran seamlessly. I was able to completely hand over my stress (and my phone!) to them an

It wasn’t until after the weekend that I learned about all the little fires they’d quietly put out behind the scenes like true professionals. Our planner also introduced me to my makeup artist, Style By Susmita, with whom I connected instantly. She has such a gift for enhancing your natural beauty and creating a calm, grounded energy - which is so important, especially since you spend more time with your hair and makeup team than almost anyone else during the wedding weekend! My planner also introduced me to my mehndi artist, who was equally incredible. We did a long Zoom consultation where she designed my patterns on an iPad. She spent over nine hours doing my full bridal mehndi but kept up the most positive, warm energy the entire time - it felt more
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | like spending the day with a close friend than with a vendor. Our decorator, Sachi from PartylandSajawa, turned from vendor to fast friend. She completely understood our vision and brought it to life with such attention to detail. Each event felt so distinct yet cohesive. She had this rare ability to take my Pinterest dreams and translate them into something even more beautiful than I imagined. Our photographer was Nayeem Vohra, whom I met at my best friend's wedding over 5 years ago. I knew from that moment that he was going to be my photographer before I even had a man or a date selected. The universe was in my favor that he happened to be free! His team has an incredible way of making you feel comfortable in front of the camera, and he always gets the best shot! Our caterer was Mogul C

During our tasting, Mogul made sure to have us try special dishes from both parts of India and absolutely came through during our weekend. Our guests could not stop raving about it!! As a dancer, our musical talent was of the utmost importance. We used Premier DJs, HR Beats, and Ambition. They knew the vibe we needed for all four events, and we didn't have a single repeated song all weekend! Our planner also recommended Pawan Varma, who is a flautist & saxophonist. He brought such a unique energy to our baraat, wedding & reception. He played "Madhanya" on his flute for my bridal entrance and played saxophone covers of all our favorite Bollywood song
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s during the baraat & cocktail hour! The outfit process was a whirlwind! We traveled to India for just a few days, so I had to make every minute count. I had done tons of research beforehand, but between choosing my own looks and helping my sister find hers, it was an adventure. Susmita, my makeup artist, was incredibly helpful even from afar, guiding me to pick outfits that complemented one another while still being unique for each event. Special shout-out to both my parents who never left my side during the shopping marathon. We also got a chance to custom make our bridal party outfits with Meetu Makkad in Shahpur Jat, which was such a cool & unique process! And finally, the heart of it all, my family. My mom was my rock throughout the entire planning process. Together, we mastered the N

My mom had this magical way of balancing logistics and emotions - she kept us organized, grounded and laughing through it all. Every little moment of our wedding had its fingerprints on it, from the tiniest décor details to the thoughtful guest experiences. My dad was instrumental in execution, helping us expertly pack inventory into bins in the months leading up to everything, and Tetris packing a huge moving truck without missing a single piece. It truly became a family project filled with so much love, teamwork, and joy. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? The best part of the planning process was doing it together. We only had 6 months from our pro

The wedding weekend goes by in a complete blur - everyone tells you that, but you don’t really believe it until you’re in it. For me, the one moment that felt like time actually stopped was in between our wedding ceremony and reception. Vipul and I had about an hour completely to ourselves, and it was the first time all weekend that things felt quiet. We just sat together, taking it all in - everything we’d planned, everyone we loved, and the fact that we were finally married. It reminded me t
