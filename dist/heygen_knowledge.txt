COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Maidens, VA Sikh Wedding by Catch Motion Studios September 25, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Shikha & Gaurav’s love story began in medical school, where friendship blossomed into something deeper, steadier, and beautifully inevitable. Their big day was not just a wedding—it was a lively, sensory-filled celebration, blending tradition, heartfelt details, and the kind of “Wow” factor that makes you pause mid-scroll and think, “This is what fairytales look like.” The Estate at River Run provided a backdrop that can only be described as architectural poetry. Of course, a wedding this spectacular doesn’t simply “happen.” Behind the seamless execution was the talented team at Planned Celebrations , ensuring that the flow of
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | traditions—from the baraat and Milni to the ribbon-cutting and Anand Karaj—was smooth, intentional, and joyful. With their expert touch, every guest felt part of the magic while the couple glided through the day with nothing but smiles. Complementing the planning was the floral brilliance of Gulmohar Weddings , who brought Punjabi and Sikh inspirations into every petal and arrangement. Their décor married vibrancy with meaning, transforming spaces into living art while still respecting the sacredness of tradition. Shikha’s bridal glow was entrusted to SKS Salon , whose artistry highlighted her natural beauty while giving her the confidence to shine from morning rituals to late-night dancing. Gaurav, meanwhile, carried himself with quiet sophistication, and together, the couple radiated th
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | e kind of energy that made guests lean in just to bask in it. The beats of Dynasty AVE set the soundtrack for the day, filling the air with energy that had everyone—from little cousins to seasoned aunties—claiming their moment on the dance floor. And to fuel that dancing? A spread by Anokha , whose flavors brought guests straight into the heart of Punjabi tradition with food that was both comforting and celebratory. Rentals by Rent-E-Quip provided the elegant foundation for the celebration, but Catch Motion Studios captured the real magic . Every candid laugh, every joyful tear, and every stolen glance was frozen in time through their lens, giving Shikha & Gaurav memories to relive forever.

Enter Royal Vivaah Creations , whose floral artistry elevated the mandir’s beauty into a dreamy canvas of color. Aditi was a vision, with hair and makeup by Shiza Ahmed , who ensured her glow matched the sparkle in her eyes. From pre-wedding glam to the final dance, every look was on point.

Their storytelling style gave each image a sense of intimacy and energy—whether it was the sacred ceremony or the glamour of the reception at The Marigold , a venue that defines elegance. No Indian wedding is complete without a soundtrack, and here’s where Kurani Studios came in—not once, not twice, but thrice! Handling DJ, baraat, and even the photo booth, they kept spirits high and energy higher. Their reputation for keeping the dance floor alive is legendary, and they didn’t disappoint. (Seriously, if you weren’t dancing, were you even at the wedding?) The couple treated guests to a feast by Moghul Caterers , whose flavorful creations had everyone lining up for seconds (and thirds—no judgment here). F
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | or sweet endings, Whole Foods Market provided the wedding cake, joined by guest cakes from La Bon Bake Shoppes and the delightful treats of Nothing Bundt Cakes . Let’s just say dessert was not an afterthought—it was a full-blown experience. Even the smallest details spoke volumes: custom cake toppers from Etsy artists, styling touches from Dreams Decor , and hair color finesse by Cece MacNeill . Every vendor brought something special, each playing a part in weaving this unforgettable tapestry of love. Looking back, Aditi & Ankit’s day wasn’t just about rituals or aesthetics—it was about celebrating family, faith, and the undeniable joy of finding “the one.” It was big, bold, and brimming with beauty, just like the couple themselves. How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | "the one"? I knew Ankit was the one when my (now our) dog, Howie, got violently sick in the car and he helped me get to the vet, clean out the car, and spent the day with me to help me keep me sane until I heard back. Ankit and I met on Hinge, and I decided to head off on a 2-week cruise with friends, fully anticipating our conversation to fizzle out as I country hopped. However, every time I got service at a port of call, there would be a random Beyonce meme waiting for my reaction. Even if I wasn't able to respond for a day or two, or if my responses were short-- he would, without fail, send me something every day. We decided to meet up once I got back, but that would be also be pushed as I ended up with COVID. Although he messaged first, I suggested meeting up for a Trivia Date once I w
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | as better, which ended up being about 6 weeks after we first started talking. I was nervous to transition to real life as that's when things fizzle, but meeting Ankit for the first time was like being swept up in a wave of calm. From the onset, he was the quiet to my chaos, the stillness to my storm. I knew I had found something special when we were no longer able paying attention to trivia because we were talking to each other. Fast forward through a few more dates, Howie decided to put his future Dad to the test by vomiting all over the car, repeatedly. Ankit handled both of us as calmly and gently as possible, and I knew that if there was ever a future with a family for me, it would be with Ankit. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! Ankit's original plan was proposing on Mt. Vesuviu
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | s, as I had tried (and almost succeeded) to convince him that Mt. Vesuvius was in Greece. I promptly threw a wrench in as I did not want to be proposed to on vacation. He rallied and orchestrated an even more personal and meaningful proposal at Duke Gardens. Ankit rushed me home after a week-long trip to Vermont and Canada under the guise of meeting some of his friends for their wedding planning. We were supposed to have dinner with them at Duke Gardens, and I was irate. Who in their right mind would say yes to dinner after a 10-hour car ride home from Canada?! I was cranky-- I didn't want to shave my legs, wear a dress, do my makeup. I wanted to curl up on the couch and snuggle with him and our pup. He got me to Duke Gardens, and we took a walk to the Orchid House. I had never been, so wh
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ile I was geeking out at all of the varieties of flowers, we was setting up to take some pictures before heading to dinner. It was in the orchid greenhouse, surrounded by lush plants and beautiful flowers that he asked me if I would like to spend the rest of our lives together. Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. Family is of the utmost importance to both us, and our families wanted to share this with our nearest and dearest. Ankit and I wanted to ensure that we kept close to tradition and prioritized simplicity. Planning a wedding is hard. It's also usually the first group project you do with your parents. Between managing personalities, competing prefere
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | nces, wants, budgeting, etc, it get's emotional and dicey pretty quickly. Ankit did a lot of the stakeholder management, and I did a lot of the logistics and execution. Our original plan was to have a small, intimate temple ceremony with immediate family and a large reception, but it was cost prohibitive, so we ended up doing a large ceremony with a slightly smaller reception in the evening. We knew from the start that we wanted a temple wedding. We wanted a place that was already steeped in the ambiance and virture of tradition, so we decided on BAPS Edison. Our AM decorator was Dreams Decor who did an amazing job with the Rose Gold and Maroon steeped mandap and backdrop. We had about 300 attendees, catering was done by BAPs. Our evening reception was at The Marigold in Somerset, with a R
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ajasthani Royalty theme. We had Moghul catering, Kurani Studios for entertainment. Wedding Art NJ decorated our event, and we had some personal touches scattered throughout-- our dogs were our cake toppers, we made personalized table tents for each tables, personalized chocolates, and our returns were our favorite Bundtinis. Hair and Makeup for both events were done by Shiza Ahmed; Photo and Video were done by Manish & Sung. How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? My vision was ivory, but we compromised on burgundy. We had started looking at lenghas, and nothing was clicking for me. Finally, we walked into Meghna Jain Modish, and I found an ivory lengha I just couldn't stop looking at. She pushed me to try it on despite us looking at b
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ridal wear, and once I put it on, I knew it was the one. I had to call Ankit and show him, and he agreed-- it was perfect. It fit our simple and traditional vibe perfectly. We had a similar experience with my reception lengha-- we just walked into a store and it was there. What was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? Ankit and I did a 'last dance' to cap our reception. We were surrounded by our closest friends and got to dance to our song as our friends lit up the dance floor with their phone lights. It felt like we were dancing among the stars. This also signaled the end to an event we had been putting together for over a year, and it felt right that we got to share it together, just the two of us. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? We still g
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | et compliments about our wedding-- it was simple, traditional, and steeped in love. Our entertainment team from Kurani Studios was amazing. They kept everyone on the dance floor the entire night, just like we asked, and some of our friends have also reached out to them for their events. Our guests also loved our Bundtini return favors-- it was a sweet little treat to cap off a night of partying! Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? We abandoned tradition as my sisters walked me down the aisle to the mandap for me to start the next phase of my life. We did this as a symbol that while Ankit may be marrying me, his responsibility to protect, nurture, and love extends to my sisters as well. Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? You

COMMENT: FAVORITE: SHARE: TWEET: PIN: Orlando, FL Indian Wedding by Lukki Pics September 22, 2025 Posted by: Shawna Comments Relive the magic of Nikhita & Neel’s wedding, beautifully showcased on the Platinum Guide Blog . How did you meet your Groom and when did you know he was "the one"? I met my husband (!!) a decade ago, in the first week of med school. We became fast friends, but that friendship didn’t evolve into more for another four years. It’s crazy to see now because at different points, our close friends and family had commented that they noticed a connection between us at various moments of our friendship. I think we were the last ones to realize it! Once we finally realized there was something more, it felt right almost immediately. L
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ike something clicked into place. We spent the next five years balancing a long-distance relationship, a pandemic, and residency training, but through it all, that foundation of friendship tied us together the entire way. Share the scoop on your Proposal Story! By the time Neel was ready to propose, six years into our relationship and a decade into our friendship, I was convinced there was no way he was going to surprise me. It was only a matter of time, and any of my best friends can confirm that I think I had my nails done every week for months. I kept looking out for signs (not the chillers of gals, I’d say). Despite that, Neel’s always had a way of keeping me on my toes. On a day I least expected it, we went for a walk to our favorite waterfront with our pup Fitz. It was cold, kinda ra
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | iny, and Super Bowl Sunday (a very big deal to Neel), so honestly, I did not have a proposal on my radar at all. Unknowingly, I was led to our favorite spot to decompress under this gorgeous willow tree on the LIC pier. And that’s when Neel proposed, in our workout clothes, and on the one day my nails were chipped and half done. It was the best moment ever, honestly. Just us, in a place we’d spent countless other days just looking over the water, pinching ourselves that we finally lived in the same city. We FaceTimed loved ones, got tacos from our local taco truck, and watched the game afterward. The next day, Neel had ALSO planned a formal proposal photo shoot on the Brooklyn Bridge. We had a blast posing, and actually, Anastasia (the photographer he hired) was the first vendor we signed
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | when we started wedding planning. We knew we wanted to have her capture the rest of that special year since she’s the one who was there to start with! Tell us how you went about planning your wedding, and your overall experience with the Venues, Hair & Makeup, Outfits, Decor Theme, and all of the other important details. This whole process can be one that’s overwhelming, especially when you’re balancing a budget with a dream vision. The venue was the hardest one for us—we had our heads set on Cabo for a destination wedding. We had everything preliminary planned out, but the day it was time to sign our contract, we just couldn’t do it. The idea of some of our loved ones not being able to make our special weekend just didn’t sit well with us. Neel was especially concerned about his grandma,
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | who he knew wouldn’t be able to get on a plane to fly down. In the end, we decided we wanted both: the resort and laid-back feel, without the cross-country flights. That’s how we landed on the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress Resort. Neither of us is from Florida, so we invited 300 of our closest family and friends (hehe) to check into the resort with us for as much of an all-inclusive experience as we could create. As for other vendors, we followed the people we knew best: each vendor was picked based on 1. testimonials from our best friends, and 2. whichever of those vendors we felt most ourselves with as a couple. The Indian wedding industry is full of amazing, talented groups, and so I’d argue you can find anyone who does a quality job in your budget. But what separates a positive and negat
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ive planning experience is how well you get along with your vendors and how much you trust them. We spent hours on calls and in-person meetings with each vendor, and I can honestly say that the process is only fun if you enjoy getting to know the people you are in partnership with. We were thrilled with every vendor we selected, and honestly, planning this wedding with them was a blast How did you select your bridal lengha or wedding dress? Did you have a favorite color in mind? When we went to India to look at bridal wear, the only thing on my mind was that my Nani (maternal grandmother) wouldn’t get to travel from India for our wedding. I wanted to pick a wedding dress that she saw me in and loved as well. I had always envisioned myself in a pastel lehenga—something different: a sage gre
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | en, a mauve. Something simple and elegant, but in a nontraditional color. But the lehnga I ended up picking was the first one I tried in stores (from Kalki Fashions). It was ornate, heavily beaded, ivory. But wow, did I feel like a bride the second I wore it! When we brought my grandma to the store the next day, she loved it as well. I actually remember asking her if we should get it, but in a different color, showing her swatches of the sage green I’d envisioned or the dusty pink that caught my eye. Politely but directly (in a way only a sweet grandma can pull off), my Nani told me to get the lehnga as is. And so we did. It was the best decision, I loved how the lehnga turned out, and it felt extra special FaceTiming Nani on the wedding day, wearing the bridal lehnga she’d helped pick Wha
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | t was the most enjoyable part of the planning process, and why? 100% the final food tastings and final decor walk-through. Both were time-intensive, but honestly, such a fun part of the planning process because it was the moment we got to show our families the fruits of all our labor! Because we were planning a destination wedding, we really had to divide and conquer various elements of wedding planning. The final walk-through and tasting felt like a culmination of months of work. Getting to see our family’s reactions to everything we picked for design, tasting so many menu items we’d already tweaked and changed and swapped — it was such a fun experience sharing that with our parents. In wedding planning, particularly in desi wedding planning, it’s so easy to lose sight of the people you’r
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | e truly organizing the events for. For us, these were the special moments in planning where we got to spend time with our inner circle, hear the opinions we actually cared about. What did your guests particularly love about your Wedding? I think we prioritized guest experience and convenience, and in doing so, a lot of our friends and family commented that they felt like they were on a four-day vacation (the best compliment, honestly). We wanted everyone to feel valued and show them how much it meant that they took the time to travel to celebrate with us. We had handwritten notes in our welcome bags that actually had a ton of goodies in them. We made sure every meal was accounted for so that no one had to wonder where to grab food between events. There was always something fun going on in
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | the hospitality suite, whether it was karaoke during the day or dancing + drinks after events. We tried to incorporate mocktails for evening events for those who usually didn’t get to enjoy an open bar, sugar-free lemonade for our diabetic guests, and a cocktail hour that was 2 hours long so that even those on IST actually got to enjoy some really fun fusion hors d'oeuvres. We had a kids’ club set up next to our main ballroom, for both the ceremony day and reception evening, with pizza, a balloon artist, a face painter, and several nannies to help ensure that parents could rest easy knowing their kids were having just as much fun as they were. By splitting up formal Indian events with more casual fun events like our garden party and our newlywed brunch, we wanted to make sure everyone had
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | time to unwind and enjoy the resort’s numerous activities. We’d created a joint WhatsApp group with groups of all the people who traveled to Orlando for open communication, to help make sure everyone felt included in all the fun. Little things all, and all, but it seemed like collectively, elements like this made everyone feel really welcome and relaxed Was there a really special moment in your wedding that constantly replays in your mind? I have two of them if that’s allowed: first, Neel and I hiding out before our Sangeet. We elected to do a high-energy entrance to launch the wedding festivities, but to do that, we had to actually wait until everyone showed up to our Sangeet (Indian standard time is a real thing, wow). That meant about 30-40 minutes when it was just the two of us. We jok
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | ed around, we practiced our entrance dance about a billion times, and our wedding planning team brought us a ton of food for just us. That was the first moment that weekend I remember thinking Dang, I really am about to marry my best friend. Second—the day after our wedding (Saturday), we had a casual brunch, and everyone had the day to just enjoy the resort. It was my favorite day—walking around getting to see all our favorite people mixed together at the pool, at the bar, on the beach, playing mini golf. Spending the day begging out with all our loved ones was such an amazing time as a bride. Shout out to my hair and makeup artist, Payal, because around 4 pm (when I was supposed to get ready for our reception), I texted her apologizing for being ten minutes late bc of how much fun I was
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | having. I remember her telling me not to worry and to just keep enjoying myself. We started an hour later, and she still managed to have me picture-ready in time! For events other than your ceremony, please tell us as much as you would like about the decor, style, dances, and all the special details. Haldi: citrus themed, our joint Haldi was intimate and reserved for our closest friends and family. No one went easy on us with the Haldi, but it was a ton of fun, and we had the outdoor event on a canopy-draped terrace overlooking our beautiful resort property. Sangeet and Garba: started with an epic entrance to Pop Smoke remixed with Rangilo Mario Dhol Na; we had so many amazing performances, including a surprise gazaal sang by Neel’s father’s best friend. Wedding day: Neel’s baraat included
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | a lime green Lambo and colored smoke bombs. Afterward, there were Bombay sandwiches, fruit chat, and Indian sodas like Thumbs Up, Linda, and Fruiti as refreshments before the ceremony. after the ceremony everyone changed into casual clothes and enjoyed time at the pool and beach- the garden party the night of the wedding was my favorite event, tons of lawn games, hand shaken spicy margs -neel and my drink of choice, a fresh paleta cart, a Mexican food truck. this event culminated into an intense game of a scavengar hunt meets musical chairs (first place took home a top notch bottle of tequila!) we had an impromptu dance party to the Latin fusion vibes of our talented DJ’s set. It was perfect weather with market lights. Favorite event hands down The reception and cocktail hour included so
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | much food, including a live chicken tikka station outside, a video booth instead of a classic guestbook to sign, a live pianist playing Bollywood tunes (a surprise for my FIL, who loves listening to the piano!), an amazing Bhangra performance by Neel and his college dance team, all in all, so much fun Do you have any words of wisdom for Brides-To-Be? Easier said than done (coming from a very type-A gal!), but try your hardest not to get bogged down in the nitty-gritty details throughout wedding planning. Things will go wrong, you’ll have to pivot on more than one occasion, opinions will clash, and stress will definitely rise and fall throughout the planning process. At the end of the day, though, every loved one involved has the same goal: to make it the best and most fun weekend ever. If
SRC:WEB https://www.maharaniweddings.com/ | you can remind yourself that the commonality for all parties involved is excitement for a really important life event, it’ll help you remember that the end goal is creating a core memory. You can stress and be upset over all the little things that go wrong on your wedding weekend, or you can let go and try to soak up every part of that weekend. The actual wedding will go by FAST, so keeping this mindset throughout the planning process will ensure you actually enjoy the wedding when it finally arrives! Anything else you want to tell us? We'd love to hear all about your other details! (jewelry, mehndi, venue, cake, bouquets, etc.) Consider a Whole Foods cake! We did a separate three-tier cake from Whole Foods, the chantilly cake with mixed berries. Our decorator decorated the cakes, and we h
